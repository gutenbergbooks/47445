<h2><a id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>In presenting this work to the public the author has no
apologies to make nor favors to ask. It is a simple history of
his connection with the Police Department of Chicago, compiled
from his own memoranda, the newspapers, and the official
records. The matter herein contained differs from those records
only in details, as many facts are given in the book which have
never been made public. The author has no disposition to
malign any one, and names are used only in cases in which the
facts are supported by the archives of the Police Department
and of the criminal court. In the conscientious discharge of
his duties as an officer of the law, the author has in all cases
studied the mode of legal procedure. His aim has been solely
to protect society and the taxpayer, and to punish the guilty.
The evidences of his sincerity accompany the book in the form
of letters from the highest officers in the city government, from
the mayor down to the precinct captain, and furnish overwhelming
testimony as to his endeavors to serve the public faithfully
and honestly. No effort has been made to bestow self-praise,
and where this occurs, it is only a reproduction, perhaps
in different language, of the comments indulged in by
the newspapers of Chicago and other cities, whose reporters
are among the brightest and most talented young men in all
the walks and professions of life. To them the officer acknowledges
his obligations in many instances. Often he has worked
hand-in-hand with them. They have traveled with him in the
dead hours of the night, in his efforts to suppress crime or
track a criminal, and have often given him assistance in the
way of suggestions.</p>

<p>He now submits his work and his record to the public, hoping
it will give him a kindly reception.</p>

<h2><a id="PUBLISHERS_PREFACE">PUBLISHER'S PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The two arch enemies of happiness and prosperity are the
Devil and the Grafter. The church is fighting the Devil, the
law is fighting the Grafter. The great mass of human beings,
as they journey along the pathway of life, know not the dangers
that lie in wait from these two sources. Honest themselves,
credulous and innocent, they trust their fellow man.</p>

<p>Statistics show that four-fifths of all young men and women,
and nine-tenths of the widows are swindled out of the money and
property that comes to them by inheritance. Every year thousands
of laboring men spend their hard earnings and beggar
their families by falling in traps laid for them. Thousands of
innocent girls and women, struggling for a respectable livelihood,
fall victims to the demons who traffic in human honor.</p>

<p>The Grafters spend millions upon millions of dollars annually
in advertising in America alone. There is not a Post Office
in the land where every mail does not carry their appeals and
thieving schemes; and they collect hundreds of millions of dollars
annually from the trusting public. The State and National
Governments spend millions of dollars a year in trying to catch
and curb these grafters. Some of Satan's worst grafters are
found in the church, working the brethren; and he has them
by thousands in every walk of life.</p>

<p>The object of this book is to protect the public by joining
hands with the church and the government in their work against
the Devil and the Grafter. The author reveals and exposes the
Grafter with his schemes, his traps, his pitfalls and his victims.
The reader of this book will be fortified and armed with knowledge,
facts and law, that should forever protect him, his
family and his friends from the wiles of the Grafters.</p>

<p>It is with the confidence that this work fills an imperative
need, and that it should be in the hands of every minister, every
physician, every teacher and every mother and father in the
land, that the author and publisher send it forth on what they
believe to be a mission of good to the world.</p>

<p><b>From Chas. S. Deneen, Governor of Illinois</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is with pleasure that I am able to say that Detective
Wooldridge has conducted all his cases with zeal and intelligence."</p></div>

<p><b>J. M. Longenecker, former State's Attorney, says</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Wooldridge has thorough knowledge of evidence and is
an expert in preparing a criminal case for trial. I have found him
to be one of the most efficient officers in the Department."</p></div>

<p><b>R. W. McClaughrey, Warden of U. S. Prison at Leavenworth,
Kans., Ex-Warden of Illinois State Penitentiary and Ex-Chief
of Police of Chicago, says in a letter to the author</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You were not only subject to bribes, but also frequently a
target of perjurers and scoundrels of every degree. You came out
from every ordeal unscathed, and maintained a character for integrity
and fearlessness in the discharge of your duties that warranted
the highest commendation. It gives me pleasure to make
this statement."</p></div>

<p><b>J. J. Badenoch, Ex-General Supt. of Police, writing Mr. Wooldridge,
says</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Dear Sir&mdash;Before I retire from the command of the Police
Department, I desire to thank you for your bravery and loyal
service. The character of your work being such that bribes are
frequently offered by the criminal class, it becomes necessary
to select men of perfect integrity for the purpose, and I now
know that I made no mistake in selecting you for this trying
duty. It affords me great pleasure to commend you for your
bravery and fidelity to your duties."</p></div>

<p><b>Nicholas Hunt, Inspector Commanding Second Division, says</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have known Clifton R. Wooldridge for the last ten years.
As an officer he is par-excellent, absolutely without fear and with
a detective ability so strongly developed it almost appealed to me
as an extra sense. If I wanted to secure the arrest of a desperate
man, I would put Mr. Wooldridge in charge of the case in
preference to any one I know, as, with his bravery, he has
discretion."</p></div>

<p><b>Geo. M. Shippy, Chief of Police, of Chicago, writing Mr. Wooldridge,
says</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your heart is in the right place, and while I have always
found you stern and persistent in the pursuit and prosecution of
criminals, you were very kind and considerate, and I can truthfully
say that more than one evil doer was helped to reform and
was given material assistance by you."</p></div>

<p><b>Luke P. Colleran, Chief of Detectives, says</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"His book is most worthy and truthful and commendable; and
I take pleasure in commending it to all."</p></div>

<h3>SHERLOCK HOLMES IN REAL LIFE.</h3>

<p class="center"><em class="italic">From The Chicago Tribune of
November 25, 1906.</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Chicago may be surprised
to learn that it has
a Sherlock Holmes of its
own, but it has; and before
his actual experiences
in crime-hunting, the fictional
experiences through
which Poe, Doyle, and
Nick Carter put their
detectives pale into insignificance.
His name is Clifton R. Wooldridge.</p>

<p>"Truth is stranger even
than detective fiction, and
in the number of his
adventures of mystery,
danger and excitement he
has all the detective
heroes of fiction and reality
beaten easily.</p>

<p>"He has personally arrested
19,500 people, 200
of them were sent to the
penitentiary; 3,000 to the
house of correction; 6,000
paid fines; 100 girls under
age were rescued from
lives of shame; $100,000
worth of property was recovered;
100 panel houses
were closed; 100 matrimonial
bureaus were
broken up.</p></div>

JEW IN THE GHETTO" />
<div class="caption">Disguised as a
JEW IN THE GHETTO</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Wooldridge has refused
perhaps 500 bribes
of from $500 to $5,000
each. He has been under
fire forty-four times.
He has been wounded
dozens of times. He has
impersonated almost
every kind of character.
He has, in his crime hunting,
associated with members
of the '400' and
fraternized with hobos.
He has dined with the
elite and smoked in
opium dens. He has done
everything that one expects
the detective of fiction
to do and which the
real detective seldom does.</p>

<p>"When occasion requires
he ceases to appear
as Wooldridge. He can
make a disguise so quickly
and effectively that
even an actor would be
astonished. Gilded youth,
negro gambler, honest
farmer or lodging house
'bum,' it requires but a
few minutes to 'make-up,'
to run to earth elusive
wrong-doers."</p></div>

life in the garb and disguises
worn by the author
in several famous

thus disguised.</p>

<h2>CLIFTON R. WOOLDRIDGE<br />

<small>AMERICA'S FOREMOST DETECTIVE.</small></h2>


<p>Clifton R. Wooldridge was born February 25, 1854, in Franklin
county, Kentucky. He received a common school education,
and then started out in the world to shift for himself. From
1868 to 1871, he held the position of shipping clerk and collector
for the Washington Foundry in St. Louis, Missouri. Severing
his connection with that company, he went to Washington,
D. C., and was attached to the United States Signal Bureau from
March 1, 1871, to December 5, 1872. He then took up the business
of railroading, and for the following nine years occupied
positions as fireman, brakeman, switchman, conductor and general
yard master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>When the gold fever broke out in the Black Hills in 1879,
Mr. Wooldridge along with many others went to that region to
better his fortune. Six months later he joined the engineering
corps of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande railroad and assisted in
locating the line from Canon City to Leadville, as well as
several of the branches. The work was not only very difficult,
but very dangerous, and at times, when he was assisting in
locating the line through the Royal Gorge in the Grand Canon
of the Arkansas, he was suspended from a rope, which ran from
the peak of one cliff to the other, with his surveying instruments
strapped to his back. This gorge is fifty feet wide at the bottom
and seventy feet wide at the top, the walls of solid rock rising
three thousand feet above the level of the river below. The
work was slow and required a great deal of skill, but it was
accomplished successfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Wooldridge went to Denver in 1880 and engaged in contracting
and mining the following eighteen months. He then
took a position as engineer and foreman of the Denver Daily
Republican, where he remained until May 29, 1883. The following
August he came to Chicago and took a position with the
Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul railway. In 1886, he severed his
connection with the railroad and founded the "Switchman's
Journal." He conducted and edited the paper until May 26th,
when he was burned out, together with the firm of Donohue
&amp; Henneberry at the corner of Congress street and Wabash
avenue, as well as many other business houses in that locality,
entailing a total loss of nearly $1,000,000. Thus the savings of
many years were swept away, leaving him penniless and in debt.
He again turned his attention to railroading and secured a position
with the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad and had
accumulated enough money to pay the indebtedness which resulted
from the fire, when the great strike was inaugurated on
that road in February, 1888. The strike included the engineers,
firemen and switchmen, and continued nearly a year. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
October 5th of that year Mr. Wooldridge made application for a
position on the Chicago police force, and having the highest
endorsements, he was appointed and assigned to the Desplaines
Street Station. It was soon discovered that Wooldridge as a
police officer had no superiors and few equals. Neither politics,
religion, creed, color, or nationality obstructed him in the performance
of his police duties, and the fact was demonstrated and
conceded times without number that he could not be bought,
bribed, or intimidated. He selected for his motto, "Right
wrongs no man; equal justice to all." His superior officers
soon recognized the fact that no braver, more honest or efficient
police officer ever wore a star or carried a club.</p>

<p>The mass of records on file in the police headquarters and in
the office of the clerk of the municipal and criminal court demonstrate
conclusively that he has made one of the most remarkable
records of any police officer in the United States if not in the
world. Mr. Wooldridge has seen twenty years of experience
and training in active police work. Ten years of this time he
was located in what is commonly known as the Levee district,
a territory where criminals congregate and where crimes of all
degrees are committed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Born in Kentucky.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Wooldridge is therefore of Southern extraction. And in
spite of the "big stick" which this terror of the grafters has
carried for twenty years, he still "speaks softly," the gentle accent
of the old South. But behind that soft speech there is a
determined soul. The smooth-running accents of the South
are in this case the velvet which hides the glove of iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are some of the deeds of valor, work
and achievements he has accomplished:</p>


<h3>AN UNPARALLELED RECORD.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>20,000 arrests made by Detective Wooldridge.</p>

<p>He keeps a record of each arrest, time, place and
disposition of the case.</p>

<p>14,000 arrests made for violation State and city misdemeanors.</p>

<p>6,000 arrests made on criminal charges.</p>

<p>10,500 of these prisoners paid fines.</p>

<p>2,400 of these prisoners were sent to jail or the house
of correction.</p>

<p>200 of these were convicted and sent to the penitentiary.</p>

<p>1,000 get-rich-quick concerns were raided and broken
up.</p>

<p>60 wagon loads of literature seized and destroyed.</p>

<p>A conservative estimate of the sum contributed annually
by this highly civilized nation to "safe investment"
and "get-rich-quick" concerns is $150,000,000.</p>

<p>300 poker, crap and gambling games raided and closed;
$1,000,000 lost.</p>

<p>200 wine rooms closed up. These wine rooms were
the downfall and ruination of hundreds of innocent girls.</p>

<p>185 wildcat insurance companies raided and closed.</p>

<p>2,500,000 bogus securities and 10 patrol wagon loads of
books, papers and literature seized. These companies paid
no losses, and there were, it is estimated, 1,000,000 persons
who had taken out fire insurance policies in these wildcat
companies.</p>

<p>They had sustained fire losses and were not indemnified.
The conservative estimated loss by these wildcat
insurance companies is $10,000,000.</p>

<p>$200,000 of lost and stolen property was recovered and
returned to the owners by Detective Wooldridge.</p>

<p>129 slot machines seized and broken up; valued at
$10,000.</p>

<p>130 policy shops raided and closed: $100,000 would be
a conservative estimate of the amount lost by the players.</p>

<p>125 matrimonial agencies raided and broken up.</p>

<p>4,500,000 matrimonial letters seized and destroyed.</p>

<p>1,500,000 matrimonial agencies' stock letters seized and
destroyed.</p>

<p>1,400,000 matrimonial stock photographs seized and destroyed.</p>

<p>500,000 photographs sent to the matrimonial agencies
by men and women who were seeking their affinities
seized and destroyed.</p>

<p>40 wagon loads of matrimonial literature seized and
destroyed.</p>

<p>110 turf frauds raided and closed: $8,000,000 lost by the
public.</p>

<p>$20,000 bribe was offered Wooldridge by the turf
swindlers to let them run, but he refused to take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>105 panel houses raided and closed.</p>

<p>$1,500,000 was stolen annually from 1889 to October,
1896. At that time there were 64 uniformed officers stationed
in front of the panel houses. Detectives Wooldridge
and Schubert were assigned to break them, which
was accomplished in three weeks' time.</p>

<p>100 bucketshops raided and closed; $5,000,000 lost
through them.</p>

<p>July 31, 1900, Detective Wooldridge, in charge of 50
officers, arrested 415 men and landed them in the Harrison
Street Police Station, and dismantled the following
bucketshops:</p>

<p class="i2">10 and 12 Pacific avenue, 25 Sherman street, 14 Pacific avenue, 10
Pacific avenue, 210 Opera House Block, 7 Exchange court, 19 Lyric
Building, and 37 Dearborn street. It was one of the largest and most
sensational raids ever made in Chicago, and will be long remembered.</p>

<p>73 opium joints raided and closed; $100,000 spent, and
hundreds of persons were wrecked and ruined by the use
of opium.</p>

<p>75 girls under age rescued from a house of ill fame
and a life of shame, and returned to their parents or
guardians, or sent to the Juvenile School or the House
of Good Shepherd.</p>

<p>50 home-buying swindles raided and closed; $6,000,000
lost.</p>

<p>48 palmists and fortune tellers raided and closed; $500,000
lost.</p>

<p>45 spurious employment agencies raided and closed;
$200,000 lost.</p>

<p>40 bogus charity swindles raided and closed; $300,000
lost.</p>

$2,500,000 lost.</p>

<p>33 fraudulent and guarantee companies raided and
closed; $900,000 lost.</p>

<p>30 fraudulent book concerns raided and closed; $1,000,000
lost.</p>

<p>28 panel-house keepers were indicted and convicted.</p>

<p>15 owners of the property were indicted and convicted.</p>

<p>This broke the panel-house keepers' backbone and they
never recovered to resume business again.</p>

<p class="i2">Emma Ford, sentenced to the penitentiary April 5, 1902, for five
years. Pearl Smith, her sister, sentenced to the penitentiary June 19,
1893, for five years. Mary White, May 20, 1893, for two years.
Flossie Moore, March 27, 1893, for five years. Seventy-five thousand
dollars is said to have been stolen by her in eighteen months.</p>

<p>$8,000 bribe was offered Detective Wooldridge to let
Flossie Moore slip through his fingers.</p>

<p>$3,000 bribe was offered by the same woman for the
address of Sadie Jorden, who was an eye witness of the
robbery of E. S. Johnson, a retired merchant, aged 74
years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>28 wire tappers were raided and closed. These
men secured the quotations from the Board of Trade and
pool rooms, and hundreds of thousands of dollars were
secured from the speculators who were victimized; $200,000
lost.</p>

<p>27 dishonest collecting agencies raided and closed;
$200,000 lost.</p>

<p>25 swindling brokers raided and closed; $800,000 lost.</p>

Detective Wooldridge, April 21, 1900, by J. J. Jacobs, 217
Dearborn street, who conducted the Montana Loan &amp;
Investment Co. He was arrested and fined $1,500 by
Judge Chetlain, June 21, 1903.</p>

<p>22 promoters raided and closed; $1,000,000 lost.</p>

<p>22 salted mines and well companies raided and closed;

</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>17 women arrested for having young girls under age
in a house of prostitution.</p>

<p>16 fraudulent theater agencies raided and closed;
$100,000 lost.</p>

<p>15 procurists of young girls for houses of ill fame and prostitution
arrested and fined.</p>

<p class="i2">$8,000 bribe offered Detective Wooldridge, September 27, 1895, by
Mary Hastings, who kept a house of prostitution at 128 Custom House
place. She went to Toledo, O., and secured six girls under age and
brought them in the house of prostitution.</p>

<p class="i2">One of the girls escaped in her night clothes by tying a sheet to
the window. There were six in number, as follows:</p>

<p class="i4">Lizzie Lehrman, May Casey, Ida Martin, Gertie Harris, Kittie McCarty
and Lizzie Winzel.</p>

<p class="i2">After Mary Hastings was arrested and she found out that she could
not bribe Wooldridge she gave bonds and fled. Some months later she
was again arrested, and the case dragged along for two years.</p>

<p class="i2">The witnesses were bought up and shipped out of the state. The
case was stricken off, with leave to reinstate. It is said it cost her
$20,000.</p>

<p>Four notorious negro women, footpads and highway robbers, arrested
by Detective Wooldridge, whose stealings are estimated by the police
to have been over $200,000. The following are the names of the women
arrested:</p>

<p>5 mushroom banks raided and closed; $500,000 lost.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge has been under fire over forty times,
and it is said that he bears a charmed life, and fears nothing.
He has met with many hair-breadth escapes in his efforts to
apprehend criminals who, by means of revolver and other concealed
weapons, tried to fight their way to liberty.</p>

<p>He has impersonated almost every kind of character. He
has in his crime hunting associated with members of the "400"
and fraternized with hobos. He has dined with the elite and
smoked in the opium dens; he has done everything that one
expects a detective of fiction to do, and which the real detective
seldom does.</p>

<p>Wooldridge, the incorruptible! That describes him. The
keenest, shrewdest, most indefatigable man that ever wore a
detective's star, the equal of Lecocq and far the superior of
the fictitious Sherlock Holmes, the man who has time and
again achieved the seemingly impossible with the most tremendous
odds against him, the man who might, had such been his
desire, be wealthy, be a "foremost citizen" as tainted money
goes, has earned the title given him in these headlines. And
if ever any one man earned this title it is Clifton R. Wooldridge.</p>

<p>It is refreshing to the citizenship of America, rich and poor
alike, to contemplate the career of this wonderful man. It fills
men with respect for the law, with confidence in the administration
of the law, to know that there are such men as Wooldridge
at the helm of justice.</p>

<p>The writer of this article has enjoyed intimate personal association
with the great detective, both in the capacity of a
newspaper reporter, magazine writer and anti-graft worker.
The ins and outs of the nature of the greatest secret service
worker in Chicago, Clifton R. Wooldridge, have been to me
an open book. And when I call him Wooldridge, the incorruptible,
I know whereof I speak.</p>

<p>I have seen him when all the "influences" (and they are the
same "influences" which have been denounced all over the
country of late) were brought to bear upon him, when even his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
own chiefs were inclined to be frightened, but no "influence"
from any source, howsoever high, has ever availed to swerve
him one inch from the path of duty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cannot Be Bribed.</span></h3>

<p>He has been offered bribes innumerable; but in each and
every instance the would-be briber has learned a very unpleasant
lesson. For this man, who might be worth almost anything
he wished, is by no means affluent. But he has kept
his name untarnished and his spirit high through good fortune
and through bad, through evil repute and good.</p>

<p>Wooldridge does not know the meaning of a lie. A lie is
something so foreign to his nature that he has trouble in comprehending
how others can see profit in falsifying. It has
been his cardinal principle through life that liars always come
to a bad end finally. And he has seen his healthy estimate of
life vindicated, both in the high circles of frenzied finance
and in the low levels of sneak-thievery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tremendous Amount of Work Done.</span></h3>

<p>But the most remarkable thing to me about Wooldridge is
the work he has done. Consider for a moment the record which
heads this article. Could anything shout forth the tremendous
energy of the man in any plainer terms? There are men in
the same line of work with Wooldridge, who have been in the
service for the same length of time, who have not made one
arrest where he has made thousands.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand arrests in twenty years of service, a thousand
arrests every year, on an average. A thousand get-rich-quick
concerns, victimizing more than a million people, raided
and put out of business; thirteen thousand one hundred convictions;
hundreds upon hundreds of wine rooms, gambling
houses, bucketshops, opium joints, houses of ill fame, turf
frauds, bogus charity swindles, policy shops, matrimonial
agencies, fraudulent guarantee companies, spurious medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
concerns, thieving theater agencies and mushroom banks brought
to the bar of justice and made to expiate their crimes.</p>

<p>That is the record of the almost inconceivable work done by
Clifton R. Wooldridge on the Chicago police force. The figures
are almost appalling in their greatness. It is hard for the mind
to comprehend how any one man could have achieved all this
vast amount of labor, even if he worked twenty-four hours a
day all the time. And yet it is the bare record of the "big"
work done by Wooldridge, aside from his routine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Life History of Wooldridge.</span></h3>

<p>Detective Wooldridge from March, 1898, until April 5, 1907,
was attached to the office of the General Superintendent of
Police and worked out of his office. During that time over
1,200 letters and complaints were referred to him for investigation
and action.</p>

<p>April 5, 1907, Detective Wooldridge was relieved of this
work and transferred, and crusade and extermination of the
get-rich-quick concerns ceased.</p>

<p>September 20, 1889, Detective Wooldridge was placed in
charge of twenty-five picked detectives, who were placed in
charge of the suppression of hand-books and other gambling
in Chicago. He remained in charge of this detail for three
years.</p>

<p>On December 13, 1890, at the residence of Charles Partdridge,
Michigan avenue and Thirty-second street, while three
desperate burglars were trying to effect an entrance into the
house, Detective Wooldridge espied them and in his attempt
to arrest them was fired upon by the trio. One shot passed
through his cap, clipping off a lock of his hair and grazing his
scalp. The next shot struck him squarely in the buckle of his
belt, which saved his life.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Numberless Hair-Breadth Escapes.</span></h3>

<p>August 20, 1891, he met with another narrow escape at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Thirtieth and Dearborn streets, while attempting to arrest Nathan
Judd, a crazed and desperate colored man. Judd threw
a brick at him, striking him over his left temple, and inflicting
a wound two inches long.</p>

<p>Judd was shot through the thigh, and afterwards was sent
to the house of correction for one year.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge, alone in a drenching rainstorm at 4
o'clock on the morning of June 23, 1892, at Michigan avenue
and Madison street, intercepted three horsethieves and hold-up
men in a buggy trying to make their escape.</p>

<p>At the point of a revolver he commanded them to halt. As
they approached him no attention was paid to him, or to what
he was saying. Seizing the bridle of the horse, he was dragged
nearly a block before the horse was checked. A twenty-pound
horse weight was hurled at him by one of the robbers, which
just missed his head. Another one of the robbers leaped upon
the horse and rained blow after blow upon his head with the
buggy whip.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge shot this man in the leg; he jumped
off the horse and made good his escape while Wooldridge was
engaged in a desperate hand to hand encounter with the other
two robbers. Wooldridge knocked both senseless with the butt
of his revolver. They were taken to the police station and gave
their names as John Crosby and John McGinis. Both were
found guilty a month later and sent to the penitentiary by
Judge Baker.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Saves Women and Children in Fire.</span></h3>

<p>March 4, 1892, Detective Wooldridge by his prompt and
courageous actions, and the immediate risk of his own life,
succeeded in rescuing from the Waverly Hotel (which was on
fire), at 262 and 264 S. Clark street, two ladies who were overcome
by smoke on the second floor of the burning building:
also a lady and two children, aged two years and five months,
respectively, from the fourth floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>This act was performed by tying a silk handkerchief around
his mouth, and on his hands and knees crawling up the winding
stairs to the fourth floor, where he found Mrs. E. C. Dwyer
unconscious. Placing the two children in a bed quilt, he threw
it over his shoulder, and seizing Mrs. E. C. Dwyer by the hand,
dragged her down the stairs to a place of safety, where medical
assistance was called.</p>

<p>Sept. 21, 1902, Detective Wooldridge was placed in charge
of the Get-Rich-Quick concerns with which Chicago was infested.
He also had charge of the suppression of gambling at parks
and other places of amusement, the inspection and supervision
of picture exhibitions in penny arcades and museums, and the
inspection and supervision of illustrated postal cards sold
throughout the city for the purpose of preventing the exhibition,
sale and circulation of vulgar and obscene pictures, the
work of gathering evidence against and the suppression of
dealers in "sure thing" gambling devices, viz., loaded dice,
marked cards, roulette wheels, spindle faro layouts, card hold-outs,
nickel slot machines and many other devices.</p>

<p>Oct. 25, 1893, Detective Wooldridge had a narrow escape
while trying to arrest Charles Sales, a desperate colored man,
for committing a robbery at State and Harrison streets. Sales
whipped out his gun and fired four shots at Wooldridge at
short range; two of the shots passing harmlessly through his
coat. Sales was arrested and given one year in the house of
correction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rides to Station on Prisoner's Back.</span></h3>

<p>June 6, 1894, Detective Wooldridge arrested Eugene Buchanan
for committing a highway robbery at Polk and Clark streets.
A few days prior he had held up and robbed Philip Schneider
and kicked out one of his eyes. Buchanan was met in the alley
between Clark street and Pacific avenue, where he resisted
arrest and fought like a demon, using his hands, club and head.
In the scuffle he ran his head between Wooldridge's legs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
tried to throw him, but Wooldridge was to quick for him and
fastened his legs around Buchanan's neck like a clam. Buchanan
could not free himself. Wooldridge pulled his gun and placing
it in the ear of Buchanan compelled him to carry him to the
Harrison street police station on his shoulder. It was one of
the most novel sights ever witnessed, and will be long remembered
by those who saw it.</p>

<p>Buchanan was convicted and sent to the penitentiary for three
years. Upon his release he applied to Wooldridge to assist
him in securing a position. Wooldridge took him to his
home, fed him and secured employment for him with Nelson
Morris &amp; Co., where he remained three years. He afterwards
committed a highway robbery in Washington Park and is now
serving an indefinite term in the penitentiary.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hangs on Window Sill.</span></h3>

<p>May 16, 1895, Detective Wooldridge, accompanied by Officers
Kern, O'Connor and Cameron, located Matt Kelly at 411 State
street, who was wanted for a criminal assault. Kelly was a hold-up
man, ex-convict and a notorious safe-blower, who several
years prior to this shot two officers in St. Louis, Mo. Kelly
was found behind locked doors on the second-floor and refused
to open the doors. Detective Wooldridge went to the adjoining
flat, opened a window and crawled along the ledge until he had
reached Kelly's room; with a revolver in his mouth he pushed
up the sash and was faced by Kelly and his wife.</p>

<p>"Go back or I'll kill you," said Kelly as he pushed his revolver
in Wooldridge's face.</p>

<p>Wooldridge had meanwhile secured a good hold on the sill
of the window, but was not in a position to defend himself.
The Kelly woman tried her best to shove him off; she succeeded
in loosening one of his hands, and for an instant Detective
Wooldridge thought he would have to fall. With an almost
superhuman effort Wooldridge broke in the window and covering
Kelly with his own revolver ordered him to throw up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
his hands, which he did. He was taken to the police station
and heavily fined.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Plot to Kill Detective Wooldridge.</span></h3>

<p>A dozen of the highwaymen and robbers on whom Wooldridge
was waging a relentless warfare gathered together on the
morning of July 4, 1895, and formed a plot to kill Wooldridge
and get him out of the way. They concluded that the night
of July 4, when everyone was firing off revolvers and celebrating,
would afford the best opportunity. They imagined it
would be an easy thing to shoot him from one of the windows
or from a housetop while he was on duty patrolling his post,
and no one would know where the shot came from, as there
was shooting from every direction.</p>

<p>An oath of secrecy was taken by all present, and lots drawn
to see who was to do the deed. In all probability their plan
would have been carried out had it not been for a colored
woman, who was watching them and heard the whole plot, and
who went with the information to the Harrison Street Police
Station.</p>

<p>Captain Koch and Lieutenant Laughlin were notified and
upon investigation found the report to be true. They took immediate
steps to protect Wooldridge by placing three additional
officers in full uniform with him, and also placing six men
in citizen's clothes on his post. Every man they met was
searched for a gun; every crook, vagrant and thief that they
could lay their hands on was placed under lock and key in the
station, and by 11 o'clock that night there was no square in
the city quieter than the one this officer patrolled, and in two
weeks' time "Coon Hollow" and the whole neighborhood for
half a mile in every direction had undergone the most remarkable
change known to police history, and this change was apparent
for a long time thereafter.</p>

<p>February 11, 1896, Detective Wooldridge, while trying to arrest
a panel-house keeper and three colored hold-up men at 412<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Dearborn street, was fired upon by one of the trio, Kid White,
the shot striking the bar of his watch chain, which was attached
to the lower button of his vest. When the bar was struck the
bullet was diverted from entering Wooldridge's stomach, and it
glanced off and passed through his overcoat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Detective Wooldridge Roughly Handled.</span></h3>

<p>In 1896 Wooldridge's fiercest fight came when he arrested
George Kinnucan in his saloon at 435 Clark street. A dozen
roughs, henchmen of Kinnucan, who were in the saloon at the
time, came to the saloonkeeper's rescue. The officer was
knocked down, his billy taken from him and himself beaten unconscious
with it, and his face and head kicked into one mass of
bruises. Through it all he managed to hang on to his revolver.
This alone saved him. He finally managed to shoot Kinnucan
through the hand and forearm, and a moment later a uniformed
man burst in and evened up the battle. Six of the toughs were
arrested, and Wooldridge was left alone by them for a long
time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fine Work in a Thieves' Resort.</span></h3>

<p>In the same year of 1896, Detective Wooldridge, disguising
himself as a cheap thief, entered a Clark street criminals' resort
and fraternized with thieves, murderers and vagabonds
of all kinds, in order to obtain information, leading Wooldridge
into the most amazing school of crime ever witnessed by a Chicago
police officer. He was accepted in good faith as a proper
sneak thief by the brotherhood, and for his benefit the "manager"
of the den put his "pupils" through their "lessons."</p>

<p>These lessons were in shoplifting, pocket picking, purse
snatching and other forms of larceny requiring skill and deftness.
When he had seen enough Wooldridge generously volunteered
to "rush the growler" and went out&mdash;and called the
patrol wagon. Twenty-three crooks were arrested this time.
Each one of them swore he would have killed the detective had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
his makeup or conduct for an instant directed suspicion toward
him.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Makes High Dive.</span></h3>

<p>November 20, 1896, Detective Wooldridge made a high dive.</p>

<p>To offset his aerial stunt he took a high dive from the top of
a building, landing on his head in a pile of refuse with such
force as to go "in over his head" and stick there so tightly
that it required the combined strength of two officers to pull
him out by the legs.</p>

<p>It was near Twelfth and State streets while pursuing two
women across a roof that his remarkable stunt took place. The
women jumped from the roof into a pile of refuse. They landed
on their feet. Wooldridge came after them. He landed on
his head. As he landed he grasped a woman with either hand,
and held them until the arrival of his brother officers effected
his release and their capture.</p>

<p>But these are only humorous incidents, things to laugh over
when the day's work is done. In the parlance of the detectives,
they belong to "straight police work." As a direct antithesis
to them is the story of the murder and the black cat, which
is in real life a weirder and more startling affair than Poe's
fantastic tale of the same subject. A black cat helped solve a
murder in a way which puts a distinct strain on the credulity
of the uninitiated.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Story Rivals Poe's "Black Cat."</span></h3>

<p>A rich man had been murdered in a certain part of the city.
He was in his library at the time of the crime. His family
was in an adjoining room, yet none of them heard any noise,
or knew what had been done until they found him lifeless on
the floor. Investigation proved that he had been shot, but not
with an ordinary weapon. The missile in his heart was a combination
of bullet and dart, evidently propelled from a powerful
air rifle or spring gun. But no clew was left by the perpetrator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of the crime, and Wooldridge carried the strange missile
in his pocket for several months before a single prospect
of apprehending the murderer appeared. Then it was the
black cat that did it. What strange coincidence or freak of
fate it was that impelled the cat to literally lead the detective
to a little pile of dirt in an alley that night Wooldridge never
has attempted to explain. But lead him it did, and when he
dug into the disturbed ground he found something entirely new
in the gun line, the weapon that had discharged the fatal
bullet in his pocket. Eventually he traced the gun to its inventor,
and from there to the man who had purchased it, a
young fellow named Johnson, and a supposed friend of the
murdered man's family. The consequence was that this man
proved to be the murderer. When arrested he at first denied
his guilt, broke down under the sweatbox ordeal and confessed,
and&mdash;killed himself in his cell next morning.</p>

<p>For mystery and good fortune in bringing an apparently
untraceable criminal to justice this incident perhaps has never
been equaled in Chicago's police records.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">On Duty in Great Strike.</span></h3>

<p>In 1900 Chicago's great building trade strike occurred in
which 60,000 men were thrown out of employment. Many
acts of violence were committed. Several men were killed and
many maimed and injured.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge was placed in charge of thirty picked
detectives from the detective bureau with orders to suppress
these lawless acts and arrest the guilty offenders. Through
his vigilance and untiring efforts law and order were soon restored,
and he was highly complimented by Chief of Police
Joseph Kipley and the public press.</p>

<p>Literally speaking, the darkest situation into which his experiences
have led him was the tunnel by which inmates of
Mattie Lee's famous resort at 150 Custom House place escaped
when the place was raided. Mattie had decided that it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
nuisance to go to the station every time the police wanted to
arrest her, so she had the tunnel dug.</p>

<p>After that when the police called on her Mattie greeted them
with an empty house and a sweet smile, while underground the
inmates were crawling on their hands and knees to safety.
Wooldridge found the tunnel and, crawling in, "snaked out"
six colored men and women whom he found in the darkness.
Versatility is a requisite with the successful detective.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Remarkable Work as a Ragpicker.</span></h3>

<p>May 28, 1905, perhaps, his appearance in the role of a ragpicker,
which led to the arrest and conviction of two negro
highwaymen, Henry Reed and Ed Lane, was his most daring
and successful effort at disguise. Lane is at present serving
a life sentence in Joliet for the murder of Robert Metcalfe.</p>

<p>The assault and robbery of a contractor named Anderson
was the occasion for Wooldridge's assumption of the guise of
ragpicker. Anderson had described Lane so accurately that the
detective was sure of recognizing him once he put his eyes
upon him, but in those days a detective to go into the black
belt looking for a criminal was to spread a wide alarm over
the whole district. Consequently he "made up." A pair of
large, worn overalls, a coat three sizes too large, a bunch of
papers between his shoulder blades to give him a hunch back,
burnt cork, a curly wig, a bag and a piece of telegraph wire,
and the erstwhile shrewd-looking detective was in ten minutes
the typical negro ragpicker who shambles up and down alleys
on the south side in hope of picking up enough for his day's
bread.</p>

<p>While thus pursuing his way Wooldridge not only discovered
the presence of Reed and Lane, but actually worked through
the refuse in a garbage box upon which Lane was sitting quarreling
with some confederates over the division of the previous
night's spoils. He even went so far as to pick up an old coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
which Lane had discarded. Thereupon Lane ordered him to
get out of the alley or get his throat cut from ear to ear.
Wooldridge went humbly out, and waited.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hero of Some Fierce Fights.</span></h3>

<p>Presently Lane and Reed appeared and went south on State
street. Wooldridge followed, and at an opportune moment
seized them both from behind. The fight that followed is
historic. Only sheer luck and the threat to kill both antagonists
on the spot if they did not cease resistance saved the
detective's life. After knocking both men down with his billy
he succeeded in holding them until a fellow officer came to
his rescue. They were arrested and convicted June 25, 1905,
and sent to the penitentiary for three years.</p>

<p>May 19, 1906, Detective Wooldridge raided the following
places: H. C. Evins, 125 S. Clark street; George Deshone,
64 N. Clark street; E. Manning Stockton, Bar &amp; Co., 56 Fifth
avenue, seizing some $30,000 worth of gambling paraphernalia.</p>

<p>Disclosures of conditions which so seriously threatened the
discipline of the United States army and navy that the secretaries
of the two departments and even President Roosevelt
himself were called upon to aid in their suppression.</p>

<p>It was charged that a coterie of Chicago men engaged in
making and selling these devices had formed a "trust" and
had for years robbed, swindled and corrupted the enlisted men
of the army and navy through loaded dice, "hold-outs," magnetized
roulette wheels and other crooked gambling apparatus.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crooked Gambling Trust.</span></h3>

<p>The "crooked" gambling "trust" in Chicago spread over the
civilized world, had its clutches on nearly every United States
battleship, army post and military prison; caused wholesale
desertions, and in general corrupted the entire defensive institution
of the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Try to Corrupt Schoolboys.</span></h3>

<p>Besides the corruption of the army, these companies are
said to have aimed a blow at the foundation of the nation by
offering, through a mail order plan, for six cents, loaded dice
to schoolboys, provided they sent the names of likely gamblers
among their playmates.</p>

<p>This plan had not reached its full growth when nipped.
But the disruption of the army and navy had been under way
for several years and had reached such gigantic proportions
that the military service was in danger of complete disorganization.</p>

<p>Thousands of men were mulcted of their pay monthly. Desertions
followed these wholesale robberies. The war department
could not find the specific trouble. Post commanders and
battleship commanders were instructed to investigate.</p>

<p>The army investigation, confirmed after the raid and arrests,
showed that the whole army had been honeycombed with
corruption by these companies. Express books and registered
mail return cards showed that most of the goods were sold
to soldiers and sailors.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Detective Wooldridge Secures Evidence in Novel Way.</span></h3>

<p>In August, 1890, complaints had been made at the Stanton
Avenue Police Station for several weeks concerning the establishment
of a disorderly house at 306 Thirty-first street, but
try as they would uniformed officers were helpless so far as securing
evidence enough to convict was concerned. Wooldridge
at that time a uniformed man, was put in plain clothes and
detailed on the case. One of the great stumbling blocks in
the way of the police had been the high basement under the
house, which made it impossible for any one to look in the
windows of the flat without the aid of the ladder. As the presence
of a ladder would arouse suspicion, the problem of viewing
the inside of the flat was a difficult one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing the other men on the case had overlooked. This
was the presence of a beam jutting out from the top of the
building to which a rope, pulley, and barrel were attached,
used as a means of lowering garbage and ashes from the second
floor to the alley. Wooldridge saw the possibilities of the rope
and barrel trick. Attaching to the rope a vinegar barrel with
holes bored in it at convenient intervals, he awaited an opportune
time, curled up in the barrel, and had himself drawn up
to the level of the windows by two officers. The lowering and
raising of the barrel being a customary thing in the building,
excited no suspicion in the minds of those in the flat, and
Wooldridge, with his sleuth's eye at one of the holes, saw what
served to drive the place out of existence and secure the conviction
of its keeper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Acts as Vendor of Fighting "Chickens."</span></h3>

<p>One of the last exploits of Detective Wooldridge before his
completion of the twenty years of service, was the breaking up
of the cock-fighting mains, which infested Chicago during the
latter part of 1906 and the early part of 1907.</p>

<p>The story savors of the burlesque. Wooldridge obtained information
as to the whereabouts of a cock-fight which was to
be pulled off. Then he sought out and purchased a pair of
decrepit old roosters, that would not fight an English sparrow,
bundled them into a sack and started for scene of action. Arrived
in what he knew to be the neighborhood of the fight, he
declared that he had been sent to deliver some "fightin' chickuns."
He was directed to an old, abandoned building. Here
he was admitted and left the antique roosters. Then he said
he was going for more birds. Instead he went for a patrol
wagon. And that was the end of the chicken fight.</p>

<p>The trapping of the Wildcat Insurance companies furnishes
one of the most dramatic chapters in the financial history of
the United States, if not in the world. It involves millions
of stolen dollars, brutal filching from the poor, heartless com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>mercial
brigandage and finally the running to earth and conviction
of the ringleaders and promoters of the "WILDCAT
INSURANCE COMPANIES" OF CHICAGO, by Detective
Wooldridge.</p>

<p>The police and postal authorities worked together. Two
thousand eight hundred letters were sent out asking for information
and gathering evidence.</p>

<p>At the trial of Dr. S. W. Jacobs, on one of these cases, there
were 200 witnesses present. Five of these witnesses were victims,
and lived in tents. Three were living in wagons: One,
Samuel James, of Westfield, Illinois, a carpenter, 64 years of
age, had a wife and six children. He had built his house
morning and evening.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bribery Tactics of No Avail.</span></h3>

<p>James accomplished the end of his heart's desire. It cost
him $900 and his health, for he was in the clutches of consumption
when the cottage was finally paid for. Fearing lest
the fruit of his life-work should be swept away by fire, James
took out an insurance policy in one of Dr. S. W. Jacobs' Wildcat
Insurance companies. The house burned down and he was
not indemnified. With his wife and six little children James
was forced to take shelter in a chicken coop, where they were
living when the broken-hearted father came to Chicago as a
witness against Dr. S. W. Jacobs.</p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand dollars was tendered to an attorney
to bribe Wooldridge in the case.</p>

<p>The breaking up of the drug ring, however, was a delicate
task. It was strongly backed financially, and it was aided and
abetted throughout the United States by political rings galore.
Chicago was the headquarters.</p>

<p>A ten thousand dollar bribe was offered Detective Wooldridge,
October 29, 1904, by the spurious medicine concerns to return
their goods and stop the prosecution; this failed. Then false
and malicious charges were filed with the Civil Service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Commissioners
against Wooldridge, which was taken up and the
trial lasted nineteen sessions.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge was exonerated by the entire board
of commissioners, and complimented by the press and public-spirited
citizens.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge secured four indictments against the
above four men, which was returned by the Cook county grand
jury May 25, 1905. J. S. Dean turned state's evidence and
assisted the prosecution.</p>

<p>J. H. Carson promoted and run eighteen different matrimonial
agencies. He was arrested eighteen times. He offered Wooldridge
a bribe of $100 per month not to arrest him. This failed
and he brought suit in the Superior Court against Wooldridge
for $5,000 damages, thinking this would stop him. The next
day after filing the suit he was arrested again, and was finally
driven out of Chicago.</p>

<p>From $10,000 to $20,000 has been offered at a time for his
discharge or transfer by these get-rich-quick concerns. Every
political pressure was brought to bear, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Ex-Chief of Police Francis O'Neill, in his annual report of
1905, states that Detective Wooldridge accomplished more work
in breaking up the get-rich-quick concerns in Chicago, in the
year 1904, than the whole Chicago police department had in
its lifetime. He did equally as much work, if not more, in the
years of 1905, 1906 and 1907.</p>

<p>The day is never too long nor the night too dark for Detective
Wooldridge to find time to succor or save a young girl
who has gone wrong or strayed from the path of rectitude.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge, without fear or favor, for many years
inaugurated crusades and waged wars against the hosts of
criminal enterprise. Whenever a man or concern could not
show a "clear bill of health" he forced him to "disinfect, depart,
or submit to the quarantine of the county jail."</p>

<p>By vigilance and hard work he succeeded in obtaining good
results. Units, scores, and legions of fraudulent concerns have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
been exposed and driven out of existence. Owners of others,
anticipating exposure, did not wait, but closed their places and
fled. Many headquarters of contraband schemes have been
raided and their promoters arrested, fined, and forced to cease
operations. During that time retributive justice has been visited
upon countless heads that were devoted to devising criminal
schemes.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge permits no creed, color, religion or
politics to interfere with him in his sworn duty. He wants
and exacts the truth, and a square deal for himself, and accords
the same to his fellow men. He has never been known
to wilfully persecute any man or to lie or strain a point to
convict him, neither will he suffer the same to be done by any
man if he can prevent it.</p>

<p>Wooldridge's motto is equal justice to all&mdash;be sure you are
right, then go ahead.</p>

<h2><a id="GRAFT_NATIONS_WORST_FOE">GRAFT NATION'S WORST FOE.</a></h2>

<h3>THE REIGN OF GRAFT.</h3>

<p class="center">Recent Exposures That Show How Strongly It Is
Intrenched.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<h3>ARE YOU A GRAFTER?</h3>

<p class="center">Those Shocked at Exposures May Not Be Clean
Themselves.</p>


<p>"A 'grafter' is one who makes his living (and sometimes his
fortune) by 'grafting.' He may be a political boss, a mayor,
a chief of police, a warden of a penitentiary, a municipal contractor,
a member of a town council, a representative in the
legislature, a judge in the courts, and the upper world may
know him only in his political capacity; but if the under
world has had occasion to approach him for purposes of 'graft'
and found him corrupt, he is immediately classified as an
'unmugged grafter'&mdash;one whose photograph is not in the
rogues' gallery, but ought to be. The professional thief is the
'mugged grafter'; his photograph and Bertillon measurements
are known and recorded.</p>

<p>The world of graft is whereever known and unknown thieves
or bribetakers congregate. In the United States it is found
mainly in the large cities, but its boundaries take in small
county seats and even villages. A correct map of it is impossible,
because in a great many places it is represented by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
an unknown rather than by a known inhabitant, by a dishonest
official or an unscrupulous and wary politician rather than a
confessed thief, and the geographer is helpless until he can
collect the facts, which may never come to light. The most
that one man can do is to make voyages of discovery, find out
what he can and report upon his experiences to the general
public.</p>

<p>Within the last year or two it has become practically a
synonym for a thief who filches public money and money of
large enterprises. It has been so largely used in the public
prints and periodicals, and more recently in books, that it has
spread abroad; and London and Paris and Berlin, in referring
to many American disclosures, adopt the word without any
translation. So today no American word is better known
either in this country or in Europe.</p>

<p>When men in office take a bribe and give away what does
not belong to them, it is more than the double crime of extorting
and stealing; it is treason. Graft is the worst form
of despotism. It is a usurpation of government by the forces
of crime. There have been many virtuous kings and honest
feudal lords, but the despotism of graft never founded its rule
upon a semblance of the moral law.</p>

<p>Graft in its highest personification is the king of the American
nation in political, commercial and social life.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Graft is Overlord.</span></h4>

<p>Overlord of 80,000,000 people in the greatest republic of
history, commanding his tens of millions of dollars annually
as tribute to graft in a million of his impersonations&mdash;was Solomon
in all his glory to be compared with this?</p>

<p>Nine states in the union of forty-five states recently have
declared that graft exposures have not been in their categories
of political publicity for a year. They are Maine, North Carolina,
Mississippi, Iowa, Michigan, Colorado, New York, Illinois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>and California. But who shall say what another six months
may bring forth?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/img022.jpg" width="383" height="600" alt="30 CENTURIES OF GRAFT LOOKS DOWN UPON ITS HEADLESS VICTIMS" />
<div class="caption">30 CENTURIES OF GRAFT LOOKS DOWN UPON ITS HEADLESS VICTIMS</div>
</div>

<p>In industrial, commercial and social life of the American
people there is not a state in which King Graft has not his
court and his following. In the capital of capitals at Washington
for generations the powers of government as dreamed
of for the republic have been superseded by King Graft time
after time, and the impeachment of his princes, grand dukes
and courtiers generally have not threatened his reign in future
generations.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Scores of Proud Names Smirched.</span></h4>

<p>Within the last few years names that have stood honored
for a generation in financial, political and social life have
been dragged down from high places perhaps as never before
in America. The court of King Graft has been attacked and
threatened as never before, and with greater showing. There
is war in the open against this pretender king, and his legions
everywhere are retiring behind their breastworks, broken but
not defeated.</p>

<p>Graft in its nakedness, has been exposed and the people are
aroused, fearing that the grafter has sucked the life blood of
the republic.</p>

<p>What they have seen is but a glimpse of real conditions&mdash;the
ulcer spots where the rottenness beneath has broken
through&mdash;but they have seen enough to realize the peril and
attack it. While the conditions revealed are astounding and
alarming, they are signs of improvement.</p>

<p>The nation is better than it was a decade ago, since tens of
thousands of grafters have been stamped out, since the leaders
of the greatest grafts of the land have been exposed to the
withering light of contempt of all decent Americans.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Life of Nation Imperiled.</span></h4>

<p>Also, born of the conditions, there has arisen a little army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>of leaders willing to engage the enemy and lead the people
against the grafters. They have been raised up to meet the
crisis of the nation's life, and with every blow they strike new
recruits are joining them in the war against graft.</p>

<p>They are still weak, and King Graft and his votaries are
still strong, but during the last year the leaders have won some
remarkable skirmishes and routed the grafters.</p>

<div class="description">
<p class="center"><b>A GRAFTER IN EVERY ROAD.</b></p>

<p>The Public stands at the crossing of the roads, wondering which way he shall go with his
money. Wherever he turns he sees a grafter in the road before him. The labels on these seven
grafters give the names of a few of those that beset every honest man's pathway. The
grafters spend twenty million dollars a year advertising; and they swindle the people out of
one hundred and sixty million dollars annually.</p></div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Nation, States and Cities Aroused.</span></h4>

<p>Senators and congressmen at the national capital have been
impeached, and indicted, and tried, and convicted of grafting.</p>

<p>Bureau officials, as in the cotton scandal, the postoffice
frauds, and other of the departments, and civil service exposes
have been arraigned by their own democracy for traitor intrigues
with King Graft, and have been beheaded.</p>

<p>State senators, representatives, treasurers and the innumerable
"small fry" of official life, together with the millionaire
briber and his henchmen at state capitals, have been uncovered
and convicted of debauching democracy in behalf of a pretender
sovereign.</p>

<p>Great cities have been shaken with the inquisitorial rounds
of investigations. Philadelphia of Independence memories has
been weighed in the balance and found wanting; in St. Louis
the prosecutor governor, Folk, has stirred corruption to the
depths; New York has been moved as it has not been since
the overthrow of Tammany; Minneapolis has been cleansed;
and the spectacular "graft hunt" in Milwaukee has been a
lesson in "how to do it." Perhaps never before in the history
of America have so many grafters been scattered to the winds,
in hiding or locked behind the bars of prisons.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">President Leads Foes of Graft.</span></h4>

<p>But King Graft wears the crown of the pretender still,
and there are few of his fighting enemies who are disposed to
rest upon their arms in either truce or armistice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The war against graft is led by the president of the United
States, who stands as the foremost foe of grafting&mdash;political,
financial or social&mdash;in the world, and behind him is
a phalanx led by Folk, Jerome, Riis, Lawson, Hadley, Miss
Tarbell, Deneen, Monnett and others of their type, fighting
the nation's most crucial battle.</p>

<p>The grafters have declared that the objects of some of these
men were selfish, but, no matter for what object they fight,
they are routing the grafters in many fields and showing to
the awakening public the peril of the situation; revealing to
a commonwealth the worms gnawing at the vitals of the republic.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forces of Graft Hard Pressed.</span></h4>

<p>Never were the forces of money and commercial and industrial
power so bewildered and so uncertain of the way to
turn as they are now. Graft, to their best interests, is still
covertly a necessity to them, but covert graft never was so
hard to keep covert, now that briber and the bribed are the
common quarry of the law. The time was when the rich man
who bought political power to his uses was unnamed, standing
apart. The grafter legislator was the cause and the consequence.
Beginning and ending with the corrupt official whose
official place was grafted upon corruption, the official became
immune from the consequences.</p>

<p>"Grafting in this state never has cost the taxpayer a dollar,"
was one of the slogans of a machine government in its attempts
to perpetuate that machine for the purposes of King
Graft and his court.</p>

<p>But this false philosophy slowly was undermined. Not only
was it found that graft did cost money to the state, but it
became a certainty that it was costing something even more
valuable than money. Graft became the one object of the
political seeker after office. The impersonal graft-giver was
a hanger-on at lawmaking centers, and the political graft-seeker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
was insisting upon election or appointment to the
machine positions.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hideous Peril is Revealed.</span></h4>

<p>The result, first, was a campaign upon the man who had the
graft to dispense. He was sought out, and was found in high
places. His lobbyists were more easily marked than was the
principal. So the law and the law's executive began also to
campaign against the lobbyists. Suddenly the "good fellow"
at a state capitol who had with him the perquisites of good
fellowship in graft measure found himself facing the interrogation:</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>The scope of the query has grown, and it is still growing, in
some quarters even to the point of requiring the man who is
elected to office to render the cost figure of his successful campaign.
All over the country, and touching nearly every relation
in official, commercial and financial life, men have been
put on the griddle of publicity by courts and commissions,
and with backs to the wall have been sitting in the witness
chair, holding to the one surly response to an irritating, penetrating
cross-examination: "Decline to answer on advice of
counsel."</p>

<p>But for all purposes of publicity have not these refusals to
answer carried light enough?</p>

<p>"The public be d&mdash;&mdash;d!" was the original first utterance of
the millionaire, designed to stop interrogations which would
not down.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" was the counter question
of the political grafter who once was charged with
grafting.</p>

<p>"Where did he get it?" came to be a question of the politician
for political purposes, and within a year the country has
heard non-political bodies asking the same question of the
millionaire philanthropist who has been trying to give it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>away. Under the growing interrogations of the time, names
have been thrown from pedestals within a year as names never
before were juggled by the fates.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CAVE OF DESPAIR.</div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Idols Covered with Slime.</span></h4>

<p>Depew, once a candidate for nomination for the presidency,
a United States senator still by some grace of toleration, and
at one time referred to in European royal circles as a "representative
American citizen."</p>

<p>United States Senator Mitchell became a derelict, politically
and socially.</p>

<p>United States Senator Thomas C. Platt was wrecked in the
wreckage.</p>

<p>United States Senator Burton became blackened in the
charges of graft.</p>

<p>Depew is a name no longer to conjure with.</p>

<p>Then followed a long list of the commercially and financially
prominent civilians, blackened, and with such blackness as
never to be white again by any of the old processes which once
sufficed.</p>

<p>Graft is still king. But, truer than of any other monarch, it
may be repeated: "Uneasy lies the head that wears the
crown."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Unconscious Grafter.</span></h4>

<p>It was a rhetorical and sensational sentence in which a recent
speaker in this city declared that the worst grafter is
the man who does not vote. But there is much more than
a kernel of truth in the words. The citizens of a republic
need constant stimulus to the fulfillment of the plainest duties
of life. The better the working of the machinery of government,
the less the average man is affected. He rarely feels the
pressure of taxation. He lives in a generation from which no
military service is demanded. He is permitted freedom of
thought, speech and religion, and almost insensibly, as a result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
he loses sight of the supreme obligation which is due
his country. He forgets that that country, in time of public
stress, may demand his time, his property and his life, drafting
him for its armies if he does not wish to volunteer, governing
him under martial law, which sets aside the usual privileges
accorded him, and exercising over him, if need be, a tyranny
ordinarily associated with despotism among the older peoples.</p>

<p>The very fact that the American citizen does not often feel
the exercise of the sovereign power, and is not called upon
to pay the supreme obligation of service, makes him careless
of his civic duties, when, it might be thought, he would feel
the utmost gratitude for the privilege of living under such
favoring conditions. This carelessness becomes chronic, and
there is abundant need for the constant reiteration of the call
to duty. If, then, a citizen is content to enjoy the comforts
and the quiet of American life without rendering any return
therefor, he may justly be called a grafter, and a grafter of
that worst sort, who robs his benefactor. For, with duty faithfully
performed by the citizen, public opinion is readily shaped,
laws quickly secure enforcement, and public servants are kept
clean and true. It all comes back at last to the individual
citizen, upon whom must rest the responsibility for failure or
success of government. It is easy enough to cry out against
the grafter in official position who puts his hand into the public
treasury. Perhaps, after all, the worst offender is the
citizen who does not vote, who does not take a lively interest in
the selection and election of his rulers, who fails to recognize
the underlying obligation of service which his country has a
just right to demand of him.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">War on Graft Just Beginning.</span></h4>

<p>But, thus far, only the beginning of the truth has been
shown. There remains the senate of the United States, the
railway companies, the Standard Oil Company, the great
trusts, the multimillionaires, to be investigated. All of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
now are in the limelight. The courts of law are under suspicion
and must clear themselves by their acts, for undoubtedly
the revelations of the last year have shaken the faith of
the people in their judges.</p>

<p>After these, the huge powers of the land, cleansed states, counties
and cities must join the Augean stable-cleaning, for graft
is everywhere. The fight against graft is only beginning, and
it will end only when a new generation learns that honor is
above money, and that "grafting" is the most disreputable
form of theft.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Wholesale Swindling Grafters.</span></h4>

<p>A chain of stores in various cities for no other purpose than
the obtaining of goods under false pretenses from wholesale
merchants is the latest novelty in the swindling line. It has
often been remarked that the originators of plans to dupe the
public might coin their brains into cash without nearly the
draft upon their originality that is called for by the devising
of a swindling game. But the criminal instinct or incentive
seems to lay its hold upon persons who might otherwise fill
a leading and respected place in honorable avocations. The
men who conceived the system of credit for goods to the
value of many thousands of dollars, which they quickly disposed
of in different cities by auction and attractive sales,
closing up their stores and decamping when they had converted
the credited stock into cash, were swindlers of unusual
calibre.</p>

<p>The police of several cities now have the task of unearthing
the frauds and bringing them to justice. They may or may
not succeed in so doing, as the scheme was craftily laid and
carried out. A harvest of $100,000 as the returns for a daring
exploitation of the credit system will be regarded, even by
the gilt-edged among the robbing fraternity, as a fine stroke
of craftsmanship. The ingenuity of these cormorants calls
for constant readjustment of honest persons to the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
created. The lesson of the so-called bargain-house fraud will
be conned, and for a long time to come it may be practically
impossible for the same scheme to be worked again. But the
feature of such enterprises is that they are designed only for
the one operation. After that they become worthless to their
originators.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Religious Graft Pays.</span></h4>

<p>"Fake" religion as a business may have a fanciful sound,
but there are plenty of men, and women, too, in this day and
age who have found it to be an extremely practical, well-paying
proposition. The readiness with which a good share
of the people are always anxious to receive any new religion,
or an old religion revamped in new fashion, makes the road
of the charlatan whose trade is the promulgation of a fake
religion one strewn with roses and money. Women are principally
his victims, although there are plenty of men with a
penchant for adopting strange religions, and from them the
faker manages to reap a harvest that makes the pay of the
average minister look like the earnings of an office boy. While
the manner of securing money through the cloak of a false
new sect is generally so hidden that the votaries of the cult
are never aware of its existence until after their leader is
exposed, the main object is never lost sight of by the leader,
and the main object is always, "Get the money."</p>

<p>Out of the great mass of religions or <span class="smcap">NEW THOUGHT</span> sects
started each year in this country, it is declared that but extremely
few are started with any idea other than that of separating
a lot of people from their money. Occasionally there
is a man who sincerely believes that he has discovered something
new and precious in the way of a religion, and establishes
a cult with the motive only to help people according to
his own lights. But the mass of the new religions, sun worshipers,
psychists, Brahmins, Hindus, theosophists, mystics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
etc., are promoted with the same object in view as that of the
old negro voodoo doctors&mdash;get the money.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Financial Yields Are Large.</span></h4>

<p>The financial yields of the new religions are incomparably
higher than is the voodoo man's gain. His followers, who
believe in black art and other foolish, old-fashioned things, are
nearly always drawn from the poorer, even the indigent classes&mdash;classes
that have but little to spend, even on a religion.
But the East Indian religionist, or the sun worshiper, draws
his clientele from the better classes, and his followers have
the money to reward him in a way that is astounding. He
dabbles not with the poor&mdash;neither, it must be confessed, entirely
with the ignorant. His victims come from the upper
walks of life, sometimes from near the top, and their name
is legion.</p>

<p>There is a Hindu who has now left this country to go back
to spend the rest of his days in luxurious idleness, the while
chuckling over the gullibility of the smart American people,
who came here with a new religion and made a fortune.</p>

<p>This man was an educated, cultured man of high caste.
Sent at an early age to England to attend school, he returned
to his native country at the age of 28, wise in the things of
two worlds, that of his own and that of the occidentals. For
a while he buried himself in the native life of a loathsome
colony of Fakers. There he learned much of their religious
style by rote, and, putting this along with a smattering of
Buddhism, psychology and sun worship, he managed to appear
in America with a new religion, fairly reeking with the
essentials required by those who want mysticism served along
with their religious beliefs.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mysticism Draws Many Converts.</span></h4>

<p>He had a new god, a new heaven and forty different and
distinct ways of torturing one's self while worshiping his deity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Mortifying the flesh through fasting and self-denial, torturing
one's self by standing with the hands above the head, etc., all
were included in the new creed, besides such things as astral
bodies and the other things that go with a new religion. He
first held forth in a sumptuously furnished city flat, where he
managed to draw to him a small gathering of the select who
love to dabble in mysterious oriental affairs.</p>

<p>The flat was a dream in itself, and when to it was added a
tall, ascetic young Hindu, with the look of the fanatic burning
brightly in his eyes, and mystic rites of a religious nature, the
effect was irresistible; at least it proved to be to those foregathered
under the tutelage of the young oriental. There
were incense burnings and incantations galore. At first these
things did not cost anything. No. The young mystic was
simply working for the enlightenment of the world, working
to spread light into the stygian darkness of the old and false
dogmas and creeds.</p>

<p>After those who flocked to his standard had been so thoroughly
imbued with the sincerity of his teachings that his
word was law to them, the money question came to the fore.
He, the missionary, wanted nothing for himself&mdash;oh, no. But
there was need for funds for the establishment of the cult in
India. A school and home must be founded for the young devotees
of the new religion in that country, a place where they
could go and live and be trained in the tenets of the creed
and prepared to go out in the world and teach. And it was
for this that the Hindu had come to this country, to permit the
chosen ones here to acquirement with the new deity by subscribing
to the school fund.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of things, when man first beheld the
sun and bowed humbly before it, it has been the custom to
heap offerings on the altar of worship. So the Hindu went
back with funds enough to start half a dozen schools
if he had been at all inclined that way, which he wasn't, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the people who were his followers are still living in the hope
that he will return.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">American Faker Gets the Coin.</span></h4>

<p>Then there is another kind of charlatan, the American fake
religionist, of which, perhaps, there are just as many as of
the foreigners with the weird doctrines of the orient. This
type of faker is coarse compared with the soft-shod, incense-burning
Hindu, but he "gets the money" without much trouble.
He is generally a ranter as far as preaching goes. His methods
are those of the shouter, his religion includes visitation of
spirits, shaking of bodies and other manifestations of divine
power. He boldly asks for contributions, not for a school to
be established for the training of missionaries for his faith, but
for the furtherance of his own work right here in this country.</p>

<p>"It takes money to fight the devil," is a favorite cry with
this type of sacrilegist. The stronghold of the religious faker
is that the people who follow him believe in him implicitly.
One faker recently proclaimed himself the son of God, come
to revisit earth, and, when assailed by a paper for it, stood
up in an audience of his believers and asked them who they
thought him to be and how they regarded him. The answer
was that he was the son of God, and his mission was to save all
mankind from sin. It is obvious that, when a man with such
a hold on a clique asks for money, it is sure to be forthcoming
without question. At times he does not have to ask for it, one
man of this kind having had money showered upon him at a
meeting by the hysterical women of his flock.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Faith in Charlatan Strong.</span></h4>

<p>This man has operated in at least four sections of this
country, has served a term in state's prison for alienating a
wife's affections along with the husband's money, has been
driven out of two towns by angry husbands; but now he is
again in possession of a following which believes implicitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
that through him, and through him only, is it possible to
obtain eternal salvation.</p>

<p>In appearance this man is a human shark, long-faced, thin
of jaw and nose, and with a mouth that is nothing but a
straight line cut in the face. In repose he might be taken
for a shyster lawyer, but when he begins to speak and the artificial
frenzy is burning in him it is easy enough to see why
impressionable women may be drawn to him. Even a strong-willed
man, observing his actions and the degree of enthusiasm
in him, is apt to feel that he can be nothing other than sincere
in his beliefs. But, if he is sincere, his sincerity runs
only towards making of his beliefs a good business proposition,
and avarice is one of his strongest points.</p>

<p>The persistency with which women will take up and practice
the cruelest of religious customs is evidenced by the manner
in which a Chicago girl tortured and starved herself to
death in an effort to obtain salvation through the mortification
of the flesh. She was not of an ignorant type, either, as might
be imagined, but fairly well educated and extremely intelligent,
with running to intellectuality. But the thrall of a new
religion got her in its power, and, believing she was sinful, she
strove to cast out her sins and died in the attempt.</p>

<p>It is seldom that pernicious practices of religion fakers
carry persons to this extreme, but deranged mentalities,
wrecked homes and depleted pocketbooks are of such frequent
occurrence as to merit a wholesale crusade against this type
of fraud, even without raising the question of religious
scruples.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Pawn Tickets on Diamonds.</span></h4>

<p>Another instance: Some working man or washing woman,
having saved up a little money for a rainy day, reads an
alluring advertisement in a newspaper that a party was looking
for a small loan on valuable family jewelry and diamonds.
The interest offered is much higher than that allowed by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
savings bank. Diamonds, as everybody knows, are just as
good as money and offer perfect security. In hopes of profiting
a little more on their savings, such prospective victims
respond to the advertisement. The party looking for the loan
appears to be a well-dressed, smoothly-talking man, who represents
himself to be the scion of a wealthy or aristocratic
family temporarily in hard luck. He produces a pawn shop
ticket, on the face of which appears that some pawn broker
had advanced on certain diamonds a large sum of money, say
$500.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/img025.jpg" width="465" height="550" alt="Two minds with but a single thought;
Two heads that beat us all" />
<div class="caption">
Two minds with but a single thought;<br />
Two heads that beat us all.<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, it is a matter of common knowledge that pawn brokers
know their business, and that no pawn broker would advance
more than one-third, or, at the highest, one-half of the actual
value of the articles pledged. It is that common belief which
the swindler makes, as it were, the psychic basis for his operations.
The victim having once jumped at the conclusion that
the diamonds offered as security must be worth at least $1,000
or thereabouts, the rest becomes easy.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Victim Anxious for Interest.</span></h4>

<p>The victim naturally considers a further loan on such diamonds
of $200 or $250 a desirable risk. The offer of 10 per
cent or more interest on the loan is another allurement which
makes the transaction still more desirable. The pawn broker
recognizes his ticket, and the diamonds, when redeemed, turn
out to be worth considerably less than the amount which the
broker was supposed to have advanced on them. The victim
loses some more by redeeming the diamonds.</p>

<p>Complaints by such victims have been coming thick and
fast into the state's attorney's office in Chicago and other
large cities. The conspiracy between the swindler and his
accomplice, the pawn broker, is almost self-evident. In some
instances indictments have been returned against the perpetrators
of the fraud, but the prosecution could not succeed.
The reason is obvious. On the face of the transaction everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
seemed to be regular, and the defendants could not be
made criminally responsible for an erroneous conclusion arrived
at by the victims as to the business sagacity of the
pawn broker or the probable value of the diamonds. And
yet who would doubt, in view of the many identical complaints,
that the plans in connection with the fraudulent transaction
had been laid carefully in pursuance of a conspiracy to defraud
the public?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">New Law Badly Needed.</span></h4>

<p>On the civil side of legal practice there is the writ of injunction
to prevent threatened irreparable injury to property
by one person to another. But in case of organized fraud
upon the public in general our modern legislatures have not
yet grown to the proper appreciation of the wise and ancient
saying that comes from the orient, "The rat hole, not the rat,
is the thief." Our laws punish the thief when caught, but
leave the "hole" intact and ready to give shelter to other
"rats."</p>

<p>The authorities may know well the fraudulent character of
a concern organized and existing for the express purpose of
fleecing the public, and yet, in the absence of a complaining
victim, they are absolutely helpless and unable to prevent
victims from being ensnared by that concern.</p>

<p>Suppose the legislature would enact a law making it a felony
for persons to set in operation any scheme to defraud the public
and fix adequate punishment for such offense, would not such
a law enable the authorities to anticipate and prevent a great
deal of that misery which is caused by organized frauds of
all kinds and descriptions, to a class of people that least can
afford it?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Postage Stamp Grafter.</span></h4>

<p>The postage stamp grafter is one of the most pestiferous of
the "toucher" genus. He bobs up in offices, on the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in hotel lobbies, everywhere and at all times. Here is the
song he sings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I'm broke, mister, but I don't want any money. I am
looking for work and have just answered an ad. in the paper,
but, to tell the truth, I have only got a nickel, and if I break
that to buy a postage stamp I can't get a cup of coffee. Just
a 2-cent stamp is all I ask."</p></div>

<p>It is too small a request to refuse, and besides there is a
chance that the fellow may be telling the truth. Anyway,
it is only a stamp. You produce the stamp, and may give
the "toucher" several stamps so that he can answer more advertisements
for work. A half day of industry at this scheme
gives any competent "toucher" enough stamps to buy a little
food, a good deal of drink and a night's lodging. There is
no difficulty in disposing of stamps thus collected, for the
salonkeepers and others that buy them&mdash;sometimes at a discount&mdash;know
they have been given, and not stolen.</p>

<p>"You are the third man that has tackled me for a stamp
today," said a man in the lobby of a downtown hotel recently
to a young man who "wanted to answer an advertisement for
work." "Here, give me the letter; I'll stamp and mail it."</p>

<p>Whereupon, to use the vernacular of his kind, the young man
made a sensational "getaway" via the side entrance.</p>

<p>Akin to the postage stamp scheme is the one of "touching"
for three or some other odd number of pennies to make up the
amount necessary "to send a telegram home for money." The
"toucher" in this case usually admits frankly that he came
to Chicago and got drunk, spending all his money. For victims
he picks the men that look like they might sympathize with
a fellow in his predicament.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Clerk Grafter.</span></h4>

<p>It may or may not be so that a sucker is born every minute.
Doubt as to the exactness of this has been expressed, the consensus
of opinion being that the average runs higher than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Barnum's estimate. But as to the natural increase of devious
and various ways for making, or trying to make, suckers out
of the world's inhabitants there can be little or no just doubt.
A new one is born every time the old one gets stale. Here
is the latest:</p>

<p>The scene of operation, which is guaranteed to be harmless
when performed, but sure to be painful when the reaction sets
in, is a small office, store, or shop, any place where the total
number of employees is small.</p>

<p>Preferably it is a place where a young woman stenographer,
clerk, or other worker is employed, and, preferably, the stenographer,
clerk, etc., is of pleasing and attractive appearance.
The more so the better, though this is not absolutely necessary.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Plays on Tardy Victim.</span></h4>

<p>In fact, the only condition actually necessary to the successful
prosecution of this new game is that one of the employees
come down to work later than others. This must be.
The operator picks a morning when said employee is late
in arriving at his or her place of employment. If the employee
is a young woman stenographer, so much the better.
Operator may be either male or female, but should be of prosperous
appearance&mdash;sort of money-no-object appearance.</p>

<p>"Is the Stool Pigeon in?" he inquires. Of course, he doesn't
call this party "the Stool Pigeon," having first carefully informed
himself as to the individual's Christian name and surname,
so as to be in a position to rattle it off with becoming
familiarity.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but soon," replies the Fall Guy. He doesn't know
that he's the Fall Guy, but he is, unless he happens to possess
more than a human average of suspicion and wariness.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Fall Guy Takes Bait.</span></h4>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry! Now, I wouldn't have come to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
this package if he hadn't promised to be here at this moment.
And he wanted it so badly&mdash;and I can't wait!"</p>

<p>"That's too bad," says Mr. Fall Guy. "But that's all right;
you may leave the package in my care and I'll see that he gets
it the first thing he comes down."</p>

<p>"So kind of you," purrs the operator. "The only difficulty
in the way of that is that I must see him when I deliver
it."</p>

<p>Nothing coarse or abrupt, you will see; instead the smooth,
purring round of the wheels that grind artistically and well.</p>

<p>Here the operator begins to bite the under lip and look at
the clock with clouded brows.</p>

<p>"Hm! I can't wait, and he wanted it so much this morning!"</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Sucker Digs Out Coin.</span></h4>

<p>Fall Guy being a friend of Stool Pigeon's (the operator has
picked him because of that qualification), gets solicitous.
"Well, there's a collection of a dollar on this package; that is
all, really." If Fall Guy looks burdened with money the
charge may be as high as $2.50. Hardly more than this. It
may run as low as 25 cents. The package contains, according
to the operator, anything from a pair of cuff buttons to a
pair of shoes.</p>

<p>And Fall Guy pays at least often enough to make the game
worth playing for the operator.</p>


<h3>FLEECING INVALIDS AND CRIPPLES.</h3>

<p>This is a story of the most despicable graft extant. For,
although it has been broken up in Chicago, it still flourishes
in nearly every other large city in the country. It is not only
despicable but it is heinous, fiendish, unspeakable. It is the
sort of a thing that causes the blood of an honest man or of
a manly rogue to boil, and long for a chance to clutch its inventor
by the throat. It is the letter-copying scheme. Real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
criminals take chances on death, or the penitentiary, and on
personal encounters with those whose money they unlawfully
seek to acquire, but the vultures behind the "ads." promising
lucrative work at home content themselves with mulcting
helpless invalids, aged and infirm persons who seek to contribute
to their own support and persons whom poverty has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
driven to desperation, and who see in the gilded promises of
the cormorant an avenue of escape.</p>

<p>The public is familiar with the advertisements which constantly
are seen in the newspapers offering employment that
will not necessitate canvassing, or peddling, and which can be
done in the home with great profit. Occasionally the "ads."
explain that the work is that of copying letters.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Write Smooth Letters.</span></h4>

<p>The victim answers the "ad." and in reply receives this
stereotyped letter&mdash;the form is the same in every instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Esteemed Friend</span>:</p>

<p>Replying to your application to write letters for us at your
home during spare time, we beg to say that your writing is
satisfactory, and we have decided to offer you the appointment.</p>

<p>The work we give out is simply writing letters from a copy
which we furnish, for which we pay you direct from this office
at the rate of twenty dollars ($20.00) per thousand. You do
not have to write any certain number of letters before receiving
pay, and all letters you write you return to us. There is
no mailing them to your friends, as most other advertisers who
advertise for letter writers demand, neither is there any canvassing
or selling anything, or anything else to mislead you;
you simply write from a copy which we furnish, and we pay
you direct. We are an old, reliable firm, always state plainly
what is required, do exactly as we promise and treat our employes
honestly.</p>

<p>The work is easy; the letters to be written are the length of
the ordinary business letter, and all we require is neatness and
correctness. We furnish all materials free of charge, paper,
etc., and prepay all costs of delivery to your home. You work
only when you desire or have leisure time, and no one need
know you are doing the work.</p>

<p>We pay spot cash for all work done the same day as received.
We use thousands of these letters for advertising our
business, because we receive better results from using written
letters than from plain printed circulars. We have a large
number of people all over the country working for us, and
if you desire to become one of our regular workers we request
that you send us one dollar, for which we will send you our
regular dollar package of goods you are to write about.</p>

<p>This is all you are required to invest, there being no other
payments at any further time, and this deposit is returned to
you after doing work to the amount of two thousand letters.
We are compelled to ask for this small deposit to protect ourselves
against unscrupulous persons who do not mean to work
and who apply out of idle curiosity.</p>

<p>We also send you first trial lot of letter paper, copy of letter
to be written (as we desire all letters to be written on our own
letter paper), also instructions and all necessary information.
After receiving the outfit you start to work immediately. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
reliable workers are needed at once, and we guarantee everything
to be exactly as represented. If you find anything
different we will refund the amount invested.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Rob Bed-Ridden Women.</span></h4>

<p>In their investigation of this sort of swindle the police discovered
that almost invariably the victims were bed-ridden
persons or women in straitened circumstances who were in
frantic search of some means of keeping the wolf from the
door. Many instances were found where some unfortunate had
taken up a collection in the neighborhood in order to raise
the necessary dollar to send for the "outfit." Persons were
found who were actually starving and who had pawned their
last possession to get the money that was to start them on
the road to affluence.</p>

<p>Of all the offices raided Detective Wooldridge did not find
record of one instance where a victim had been able to keep
the requirements of the swindlers. The supposed letter sent
to be copied was generally about 800 words in length, full of
words difficult to spell, of rude and complicated rhetorical construction
and punctuated in a most eccentric manner. The
task imposed was practically a life-time job, and even if anyone
had fulfilled it there were a hundred loop-holes whereby the
thieves could escape payment by declaring their specifications
had not been heeded to the letter.</p>

<p>The "outfit" consisted of a cheap penholder, a pen and a
box of fake pills.</p>

<p>Imagine the joyous anticipation with which a starving cripple
would await the arrival of the "outfit" that was to give
him the opportunity of prolonging existence! The bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
hopes of the work-worn widow who expected by this genteel
means to keep her little ones in bread!</p>

<p>Think of the despair of both upon discovering they had
paid out money so sadly needed&mdash;money which probably had
been begged or borrowed&mdash;only to discover that they had been
victimized instead of benefited!</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">"Operators" Cringing Cowards.</span></h4>

<p>Trembling, cringing, whining specimens of humanity were
found in charge of each of these fakers' dens when Detective
Wooldridge swooped down upon them. They were typical of
their graft&mdash;small, mean, snake-like, cowardly. None among
them was found who would bid defiance to the officers, who
would resist intrusion by the law or who would go into court
and fight. All were cheap and dirty in mind, loathsome,
shrinking, snarling, but not daring to bite.</p>

<p>Among those driven out of business by Detective Wooldridge
were the Twain Novelty Company, the Leslie Novelty Company,
the Illinois Industrial Company and Blackney &amp; Company.</p>

<p>"I have raided all classes of swindling institutions," said
Wooldridge, "but it gave me more pleasure to run down these
fellows than all the others put together. They did not dare
try to get money out of people who could afford to lose it, or
who were out in the world where they could talk with others
of more experience. Their dupes were in almost every instance
the most pitiable objects of the communities in which
they lived. The facts disclosed by these raids were enough to
fill the heart of the blackest grafter with indignation and a
desire to trounce the perpetrators."</p>


<h3>SHARKS RUIN BUSINESS MEN.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">New Line of Financial Graft.</span></h4>

<p>A new loan shark, or self-styled "financial agent," who preys
on the business man and manufacturer, robbing him of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
money and business more relentlessly than the old-time loan
shark ever dared with the helpless wage earner, has made his
appearance in Chicago and says he has come to stay.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 545px;">
<img src="images/img027.jpg" width="545" height="600" alt="MR. FIRST MORTGAGE; FIELD OF RISKY INVESTMENTS" />
<div class="caption">MR. FIRST MORTGAGE; FIELD OF RISKY INVESTMENTS</div>
</div>

<p>Under the guise of discounting a manufacturer's accounts
at his usual rate of discount, the "financial agent" secures
his first hold on the struggling manufacturer, who sees the
opportunity to enlarge his business by collecting cash for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
merchandise as he sells it. But the first step with the "financial
agent" means entering the portals of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The loan shark first finds for his victim an industrious, hard-working
manufacturer or wholesaler, who by his push and perseverance
has built a business beyond his capital, and approaches
him.</p>

<p>"You have a good business here," remarks the agent. "If
your customers all paid cash it would be pretty easy sailing.
Life would be one long, sweet song if everyone paid for goods
as soon as they were ordered, wouldn't it?"</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Offer of Cash Arouses Interest.</span></h4>

<p>Even the largest manufacturer in the country could not but
accede to this.</p>

<p>"I have been watching your business for some time with a
great deal of interest," continues the suave grafter, "and I
would be glad to discount your bills at the regular rate of discount,
so it would cost you nothing and you would have an
opportunity to double your business.</p>

<p>"I presume you give the regular trade discount of 1 per
cent a month for cash. On that I can save you a little money
and help your credit materially. You receive 1 per cent a
month on your purchases.</p>

<p>"This you cannot take, as you are cramped for money, because
your customers do not pay their bills promptly. Thus
you lose 2 per cent a month by not buying and selling for
cash."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Gets $800 for $1,000.</span></h4>

<p>The manufacturer begins to see a thriving business on a
cash basis without exposing his weakness, and agrees to allow
the banker to discount his bills.</p>

<p>"In the morning," begins the agent in explanation of his
system, "you send us $1,000 worth of duplicate invoices of
the goods which you shipped today, with shipping bills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> attached.
You attach to the invoices a note for $1,000, so the
account may be kept from the notes, and not from the invoices
which we hold. In return for the note we will send you a
check for $800, less our commission of 2 per cent a month,
just what you are paying now because your business is not
done on a cash basis. The $200, or 20 per cent, we have to
deposit in the bank which loans us the money which we in
turn pass to you. When any bills are paid we will refund
your 20 per cent which we hold. Any bank compels us to
have a representative in your store to look after our interests,
as a matter of form. We will just appoint your bookkeeper&mdash;a
matter of form entirely. Once a month we will send a man
over to check up your books. He will see that none of our
money has been overlooked."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Begins to Show His Teeth.</span></h4>

<p>All this sounds businesslike and plausible, and the arrangement
runs smoothly for a time, probably six months, to allow
the manufacturer time to sell all his open accounts to the
financial agent. Then the loan shark sends in a statement of
the account, and, if the manufacturer complains, begins to show
his teeth.</p>

<p>On the statement appears all money the manufacturer has
received and in addition an extra charge for $50 a month to
cover the services of their agent&mdash;the manufacturer's own
bookkeeper. Also an additional charge of from 1 to 2 per
cent for additional service rendered, although the agency has
had absolutely nothing to do with the accounts beyond holding
them as security. All overdue accounts are charged back to
the manufacturer, and a request for a check to take them up
immediately accompanies the statement.</p>

<p>As few accounts, if allowed to mature at all, are received by
a manufacturer on the exact day when due, the check called
for often is a formidable one. The manufacturer is at his
wits' end. He goes to the agency post haste and, after they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
find it is impossible to hold him up for a check, they say:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, never mind, the bank&mdash;always the bank&mdash;is pressing
us on those overdue accounts, but we can hold up the 20
per cent until these accounts are taken care of. That will
be satisfactory, we are sure."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img028.jpg" width="600" height="441" alt="DEBT" />
<div class="caption">DEBT</div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Loses His 20 Per Cent.</span></h4>

<p>After this the manufacturer's chance of ever seeing anything
more of his 20 per cent has vanished. Each day the agency
trumps up some fictitious charge of stamps, new check books,
extra labor, taxes, additional fees or other charges that could
originate nowhere but in the brain of a financial crook.</p>

<p>Finally the manufacturer finds he has nothing on his books
but accounts belonging to the agency, on which he is paying
carrying charges of from 5 to 10 per cent a month. The
agency refuses to return his 20 per cent, which they claim
has been charged off by the bank to take care of the overdue
accounts.</p>

<p>The victim, seeing the plight in which he is placed, demands
an accounting and threatens legal proceedings. The agency
in turn demands he give them an itemized statement of each
account, which they have. They agree to check them up, and,
if found correct, promise to give him a check for the 20 per
cent which they hold. That night the light burns late over
the bookkeeper's desk in the manufacturer's office. In the
morning the statements go to the office of the loan shark, who
says:</p>

<p>"I'll have the auditor check them up and send you a check
as soon as we find out everything is straight."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Trade Statements to Customer.</span></h4>

<p>The manufacturer leaves the office. The loan shark gets
busy with the statements, and stamps each of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This account has been transferred to Killem's Mercantile
Company. You are notified to pay this account to no one else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p></div>

<p>These statements are mailed to the customers. When the
manufacturer returns the loan shark greets him cordially and
remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Unfortunately one of my clerks mailed out a lot of your
statements last night, but I guess that won't matter. He
stamped on them that they had been transferred to us and
sent them out as he does everyone else's. He didn't understand.
I am sorry."</p></div>

<p>As expected, the manufacturer, when he sees his business
and confidence abused in this manner, flies into a rage. Then
the suave agent takes the bull by the horns and issues his
ultimatum.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our bank"&mdash;always "our bank"&mdash;"thinks we are not getting
all the money coming to us from your account. They
demand that in the future you deposit all your checks with
us. I am sorry, for I know everything is straight, but your
using us as a bank will last but a few days. Everything will
then run smoothly again."</p></div>

<p>And unless some friend comes to the aid of the manufacturer
the agency's prophecy comes true, and it does last but
a little while.</p>


<h3>SHREWD BEGGAR GRAFT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Pretend to be Deaf, Dumb and Blind, Playing on Sympathy&mdash;How
Philanthropy is Humbugged&mdash;Begging for
Money to Reach Home&mdash;An Army of Frauds and Vagabonds&mdash;Mastering
the Deaf Mute Language for Swindling
Purposes&mdash;The Public Should be Careful in
Disbursing Alms.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Speech is so common, eyesight so precious, that he who
would appeal for charity needs no better warrant than that he
is dumb or blind. In an age when words are multiplied and
golden silence is seldom found, the very fact that lips can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
give no utterance is so unusual that their mute assertion of
misfortune is seldom questioned. There is nothing so pitiful
in all the world as an asylum for the blind. There is nothing
which so draws one to share the burdens of another as the appeal
of him in whom the wells of speech are all dried up. We
sympathize with illness, we grieve at the misfortune which
visits our friends, we mourn with them when bereavement
comes, but all these things are in the course of nature. They
are sad, but they may be expected. But then a figure in health
rises and asks for charity in the hushed language of the mute,
philanthropy halts and humanity gives alms. But if the dumb
can evoke assistance, assuring of sincerity and disarming doubt,
how hushed is the questioning when the blind apply! How
much stronger than speech or silence are the sightless eyes that
stare unblinking at a darkened world! How sad is the
fate of that man who was buried by demons when God cried
out, "Let there be light"!</p>

<p>But not every man is mute who stretches out his hand in
silence. Laziness is such an awfully demoralizing vice that
some who choose to beg a living and decline work are even
base enough to feign a misfortune they ought to fear. Fellows
who find the winter pinching and the ranks of vagabonds full
to repletion arm themselves with a slate and pencil and haunt
the public with appeals for help on the untrue claim that
they are dumb. One of the most persistent beggars of this
kind makes the rounds of residence districts with a printed
card on which is stated the bearer's desire to reach his home
in some distant city&mdash;the destination varies from time to time&mdash;together
with a long-primer endorsement by a group of names
which no one knows. The fraud always asks for some slight
money offering&mdash;nothing can be too small&mdash;with which to assist
him in the purchase of a ticket.</p>

<p>Usually his paper shows that he needs but a very little
more, and he asks one, by a series of pantomimic signs, to
enroll his name, together with the sum advanced, in regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
order on a blank list which he tenders with his touching appeal.
He is so well drilled as never to be surprised into speech,
and looks with such straight, honest eyes into the faces of
the women, who form much the larger number of his victims,
that they cannot question him and usually give up a dime or
a quarter without a struggle. The beggar can readily collect
a good day's wages in this manner, and it is a matter of surprise
if he does not receive an invitation to partake of food
three or four times a day. He never lets his list get full.
However small a margin he may lack of having raised the
sum needed to buy his ticket to his home, he never gets quite
enough, for nothing is easier than to stop in some secluded
spot and erase the names of his latest donors, thus proving
to those on whom he shall presently call that their help is
not only needed, but will so nearly end the necessity for continued
appeals. This class of beggar never looks like a dissipated
man, is always polite, and bears refusal in so noble a
way that nine times out of ten the flinty-hearted women who
refused him at the back door hurry through to the front and
give the more generously that they have harbored suspicion.</p>

<p>Another set of leeches have mastered the deaf mute language,
and always ask with a pleading, painful face which meets you
as your eyes lift from his written questions, if anyone in the
house can talk with him. He supplements the penciled question
and the eloquent glance of eyes trained by long use in
the art with a few rapid passes of his hands, a few dexterous
wavings of the fingers, in a language you have heard of and
read about, but cannot understand. If the unexpected happens
and a person be present who can converse with him,
your beggar is sure of some entertainment, and the usual
scene of one you know to be honest talking to one who may
be equally so, and certainly seems needy, will almost infallibly
wring from you the coveted assistance. It is like two
minstrels at a Saxon court. You know your own has seen
the holy land, though you have not, and as he tells you, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
thread-bare guest talks familiarly and correctly of distant
realms. That is all any one can know to a certainty, but you
give him the benefit of the chance that he may be honest, and
help him with such loose change as comes to hand. Time and
again the pretended mutes have been detected in their imposture
by men who pitied a misfortune and gave money at
their homes in the morning to see it spent for drink by an
arguing, contentious fellow in the evening.</p>

<p>Some beggars even assume the appearance of blindness, and
haunt the homes of comfortable people, led by a little girl and
asking alms in the name of an affliction that is always eloquent
of need. He will sometimes carry a small basket full of
pencils, or other little trinkets, and glazes over his evident
beggary with the appearance of sales. But he does not hesitate,
once the money is in his hands, to ask his patron to give
back the pencils, as he cannot afford to buy any more. These
people can sometimes see as well as the child that seems to
lead them, and yet their eyes, when they choose to assume their
professional attitude, seem covered with a film through which
no light can penetrate.</p>

<p>The public should be chary in bestowing charity, and especially
to able-bodied men who appear blind, deaf and dumb,
or are still claiming to be victims of some recent disaster.
Most any one who has charity to bestow can easily think of
some deserving and honest unfortunate in their own neighborhood.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Paralytic a Bad Actor.</span></h4>

<p>The most transparent fraud on the streets of the great cities
is the pseudo-paralytic. At almost any street corner can be
seen what purports to be a trembling wreck of a man. His
legs are twisted into horrible shapes. The hand which he
stretches forth for alms is a mere claw, seemingly twisted by
pain into all sorts of distorted shapes, trembling and wavering.
The arms move back and forth in pathetic twistings as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
pains were shooting up and down the ligaments with all the
force of sciatica.</p>

<p>The head bobs from side to side as if it were impossible to
keep it still. And the words which come from the half-paralyzed
mouth are a mere mumble of inarticulate sounds, as if
the tongue, too, were suffering torture.</p>

<p>A more pitiable sight than this could not be conjured up.
And the extended hat of the victim of what seems to be a
complication of St. Vitus dance, paralysis, sciatic rheumatism,
and the delirium tremens, is always a ready receptacle for
the pennies, nickels and dimes of the thoughtless. This is one
side of the picture; now look on the other.</p>

<p>It is dusk. Just that time of day when the lights are not
yet brightening the streets, and when the sun has made the
great tunnels between the sky-scrapers, ways of darkness. Detective
Wooldridge is watching. He has been watching two of
the deplorable fraternity for two hours. As the dusk deepens
he sees them both arise, dart swiftly across the street and board
a car. By no mere chance is it that they are both on the same
car. The detective follows. Before a low saloon on the West
Side the victims of innumerable diseases descend from the
car, walking upright as six-year soldiers on parade. They
enter the saloon. They seat themselves at a table behind an
angle in the back which conceals them from the street. The
detective loiters down to the end of the bar and watches. From
every pocket, even from the hat rim, pours a pile of coins.</p>

<p>The two sort out the quarters, the nickels, the pennies. The
heaps are very evenly divided over two or three cheap whiskies
or a couple of bottles of five-cent beer.</p>

<p>Then the real finale comes. Detective Wooldridge gets busy,
and a goodly portion of the spoil finds its way out of the hands
of the sharpers in the way of a fine.</p>

<p>But for every one of these paralytic frauds caught there are
dozens, even scores, who get away unscathed. It is the estimate
of the best detectives that not one in a thousand of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
paralytic beggars is genuine. It is one of the most bare-faced
cases of deception of the public which comes under the notice
of the police.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Easy Money From Kind Hearts.</span></h4>

<p>Charity covers a multitude of sins, almost as many backs,
and quite a bit of graft.</p>

<p>Thoughtless giving is almost a crime. It serve to encourage
idleness, and idleness is at the bottom of more crime than any
other one thing, unless it is poverty.</p>

<p>Here is a story, given in the words of the man himself, which
shows how the charity graft is worked in a number of ways.
It covers several fields, and is so dramatic that it is given as
the best example of all-round charity grafting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In experience in charitable work last summer I discovered
some of these truths. It was the first time in all my
life that I ever engaged in any charitable enterprise, and the
needy that I sought to relieve was myself.</p>

<p>"Any one will beg, borrow, or steal in the name of charity.
They may be as personally honest as a trust magnate&mdash;and they
would be horrified at the idea of begging or stealing for themselves,
but charity makes them respectable. At least this is
the theory I worked on.</p>

<p>"I was broke and far from home. I decided that I would
starve or steal rather than beg. Then a fellow I met accidentally
put me on to a way of making a living.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">For the Benefit of the Heathen.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He had a lot of literature either really from a big church,
charitable organization, or fraudulently printed, and he explained
to me that I was to sell these 25 cents a copy for the
benefit of the heathen somewhere, or home missions. I was
to get 25 per cent of the money resulting from such sales.</p>

<p>"About a week later, when I had received $12 besides a
little expense money from him. I discovered that he was keeping
all the money. I took the rest of the literature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> destroyed
it. Three days later, when I was hungry, I rather regretted
destroying it.</p>

<p>"I joined a circus that was moving toward my home town
in Western Iowa, intending to leave it there and quit being a
tramp. I was then down in Eastern Pennsylvania. I was a
canvas hand. We went west by a tortuous route, and I never
could accumulate enough coin to pay my way home, so was
forced to stick to the place for many weeks.</p>

<p>"The second week one of the canvas hands came to me and
asked me to circulate a subscription paper among the men for
the benefit of one Will Turner, a member of the band, who,
he said, had dropped off the train while running over from
the last stop, and badly injured himself.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Gave the Money to Canvas Boss.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I circulated the paper. The man told me he already had
collected from the band on another subscription paper, so I
needn't go to them. The man subscribed over $40 to help
Turner, and I gave the money and the paper to the canvas
boss who asked me to make the collection.</p>

<p>"He took it, and remarked gratefully that he would make
it all right with me. I didn't catch the significance of the
remark then. About a week after that the same canvas boss
came again with another subscription paper for the benefit of
John Kane, who, he said, was a gasoline lamp tender and had
been horribly burned and taken to the hospital. He told me a
graphic story of the accident that aroused all my sympathy. I
took the paper and worked hard on it during the afternoon
and evening performances, and, as it was the day after pay day,
I collected nearly $100.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Worked the Game Once a Month.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I got a shock when I took the money to the canvas boss.
He gave me $50 and said:</p>

<p>"'That's your share. We'll work it again next pay day.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I went at him, and we had quite a fight. We were
both arrested, and at the hearing next morning I learned that
he had been working the game with that same circus about
once a month. There were so many with the outfit and so few
of them knew each other by name, and accidents were so numerous,
that no one suspected him. He had grown afraid to work
it for himself and used me for a tool.</p>

<p>"The show had pulled out and the boss and two others who
had been arrested with us took the first train back to it. I
used the $50 to pay my fine and get home, where I found work
and honesty&mdash;and, as soon as possible, I sent to the chief horseman
with the show $50, to be added to the fund for the benefit
of the next person really hurt, telling him the entire story.
He wrote that he had been among those who helped kick the
canvas boss out of the car after he read my letter."</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">In Name of Charity.</span></h4>

<p>There are probably more "touches" perpetrated in Chicago
by professionals in the name of charity than under any other
guise. In this matter, more of the protection of honest charities
than for the protection of the public, the police have taken
a hand and done a great deal to weed out and punish the solicitors
for fake charities. An imaginary home for epileptics
was one of the favorite plans. There was a home for this class
of unfortunates that was honestly run, and the peculiar sympathy
enlisted by the mention of the word epilepsy was seized
upon by dishonest schemers. Professional women solicitors
were garbed as "nurses" and sent forth. They were mostly
austere-looking women and silent. Their work of nursing
epileptics was supposed to produce this austere silence. This
supposed charity appealed with uncommon strength to most
people because these "nurses" were supposed to be performing
the most unpleasant work imaginable amidst the most grewsome
surroundings. Large sums were collected in this way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the promoter keeping everything above the liberal commission
paid to solicitors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">

<div class="caption">RACHEL GORMAN</div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">This One Made Fortune.</span></h4>

<p>Rachel Gorman was the originator of the "nurse for epileptics"
graft, and raked in thousands of dollars before she
finally was rounded up by the police. Not one cent of all the
money collected by her and her garbed and hired solicitors ever
got past their pockets. In this case the most shining marks
were selected. William Jennings Bryan was touched for $100.
as was the Governor of Illinois, and many others. This money
for imaginary epileptics came so easily that the Gorman woman
confessed that it was almost a shame to take it.</p>

<p>There is little excuse, however, for Chicago men and women
allowing themselves to be talked out of money for charity. In
no great city are the charity working forces better organized
or better known. For virtually every form and case of need
there is in Chicago a distinct form of honest, well-organized
charity. This condition grew out of necessity, and promiscuous
giving to "touchers" who plead as qualification charity
cases is dying out as the public comes to know more of the
comprehensive systems for the help of the worthy and unfortunate.</p>

<p>It took the hotel detectives years to check the "toucher" with
the fake bank account that operated largely in the hotel lobbies.
Now he works in other places. He carries a bank book
that has all the superficial marks of genuineness. He engages
you in conversation, and at what he considers the right psychological
moment, he drops a feeler like this:</p>

<p>"It's h&mdash;&mdash; to be without money when you've got plenty,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>If you have met this type of "toucher" before, you instantly
see it coming and chase off to a most important engagement.
If not, you only can agree. Being without money when you
have none is bad; being broke when you have money is worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here," says the "toucher," "here is my bank book.
Look at this balance?"</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Often Worth the Price.</span></h4>

<p>A glance seems to show that the bank owes your new acquaintance
many thousands. He then tells how it happened,
how he came to be without a cent when he was so far to the
good with his banker. It's a complicated tale, too long to tell
here. There are lost letters, the cashing of checks for friends
and, confidentially, a touch of the pace that flattens bank
accounts. By this time you see your finish. When you seek
to escape you find yourself backed up to the wall with no
chance to sidestep. The best you can do is to scale the original
touch from $1 to 50 cents, thereby making 50 cents for
yourself and 50 cents for the "toucher."</p>

<p>To "stand for" all the "touches" that are made in Chicago
one would require an income far in excess of that enjoyed
by most. Those that are responded to are those in cases where
the donor generously thinks that the "toucher" really needs
the money. Probably in the vast majority of cases there is no
delusion as to the fiction woven in order to drag forth the
nickel, the dime, the quarter or the dollar. Often it is worth
the price to hear the fiction.</p>

<p>But after all one feels refreshed when a frank but hoarse
and trembling hobo says:</p>

<p>"Say, Mister, me t'roat is baked and me coppers sizzlin'.
Gimme de price of a drink. Did you ever feel like jumpin'
from de bridge fur lack of a stingy little dime fur booze?"</p>

<p>Here, you feel, is no misrepresentation. Here you may invest
a dime without feeling that you have been stung.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Raffles Bank Robbery.</span></h4>

<p>One of the most annoying of small grafts is the raffle, as
conducted for gain. It is bad enough to be held up for 25<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
cents or 50 cents for a ticket which entitles you to a chance
on a rug or a clock when you reasonably are sure that the proceeds
will go to charity, but no man likes to be fooled out of
his small change by a cheap grafter, even if the grafter happens
to need the money.</p>

<p>A story is told of two printers who lived for a month on a
cheap silver watch which they raffled off almost daily until they
had "worked" nearly all the printing offices of any size in
town. These typographical grafters are unworthy of the noble
craft to which they belong. They pretended to be jobless on
account of last year's strike, and unable to live with their
families on the money furnished by the union.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How Skin Raffle is Worked.</span></h4>

<p>During the noon hour, or about closing or opening time, one
of the men would saunter into a composing room and put up a
hard luck story. He had an old silverine watch that he wanted
to raffle off, if he could sell twenty tickets at 25 cents each.
He usually managed to sell the tickets.</p>

<p>About the time the drawing was to take place the confederate
entered and cheerfully took a chance and won the watch
without any difficulty. Thus, they had the watch and the $5
also. They would split the money, and on the first convenient
occasion the raffle would be repeated at another place, and by
some trick known to themselves the drawing was manipulated
so that the confederate always won the watch.</p>

<p>A South Side woman recently had 500 raffle tickets printed,
to be sold at 10 cents each, the drawing to be on Thanksgiving
day, for a "grand parlor clock," the proceeds to be for the
benefit of a "poor widow." As the woman herself happens to
be a grass widow, and as the place of the drawing could not be
learned, neither could there be obtained a sight of the clock,
it is not difficult to guess the final destination of $50 for which
the tickets were sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Popular Game in Saloons.</span></h4>

<p>At many saloons and cigar stores there is a continuous raffle
in progress for a "fine gold watch." It is well for those who
buy chances to inspect the time piece with a critical eye. One
of these watches was submitted to a jeweler by the man who
won it. "It's what we call an auction watch," said the expert.
"It is worth about 87 cents wholesale. The case is gilded, and
the works are of less value than the movement of a 69-cent
alarm clock. It was keep time until the brass begins to show
through the plate, and it may not."</p>

<p>One of the attractive forms of the raffle ticket game is valuing
the tickets at from 1 cent up to as high as desired. The
man who buys a chance draws a little envelope containing his
number. If he is lucky and draws a small number he is encouraged
to try again. This is a sort of double gamble, and
many men cannot resist the temptation to speculate upon the
chances, simply in order to have the fun of drawing the little
envelopes.</p>

<p>Of course, many of the raffles are for cases of genuine charity,
and it is an easy way to raise a fund for some worthy object.
Many a person would not accept an outright gift, even
in case of sickness or death, will permit friends to raffle off a
piano or a bicycle for a good round price in order to obtain a
fund to tide him over an emergency. To buy tickets for this
kind of a raffle is praiseworthy.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Raffle is Lottery by Law.</span></h4>

<p>But sharpers are not above getting money by the same means.
If a strange man, or a doubtful looking woman, wants to sell
you a chance for the benefit of "an old soldier," or a "little
orphan girl," or a "striker out of work," it might pay you to
investigate.</p>

<p>But here is where the easy money comes in for the sharper.
It is too much trouble to investigate, and the tender-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
person would sooner give up the 10, 25 or 50 cents to an unworthy
grafter than to take chances of refusing to aid a case of
genuine need.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is what might be called a sort of legitimate
raffle business. Of course, the raffle is a lottery under the
law, and, therefore, is a criminal transaction. But in many
cases goods of known value, but slow sale, are disposed of
through raffles, and the drawings conducted honestly. A North
Side man disposed of an automobile in this way. It had been
a good wagon in its day, though the type was old. He wanted
to get a new one, and as the makers would not allow him anything
in exchange for the old. He sold raffle tickets to the
amount of $500, and the winner got a real bargain&mdash;the losers
paying the bill.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Raffles That Are Steals.</span></h4>

<p>A group of young men who wanted to build themselves a
little club house in the Fox Lake region, resorted to a raffle
that was almost a downright steal. They had the printer make
them tickets, and each one went among his friends and organized
a "suit club," selling chances for a $30 tailor-made
suit. Of course those who invested understood that the suit
probably would be worth about $18, but they were satisfied
to help build the club house on that basis, and besides they
thought they had a fair chance to get the suit.</p>

<p>It was learned afterward by accident that there were twenty
"series" of tickets sold by these young men, and instead of each
series standing for a suit, only one drawing was held, and only
a single suit made for the entire twenty series of tickets. In
other words, they sold $500 worth of tickets for a $30 suit of
clothes. They built their club house, however, and laughed
at the man who kicked because he thought he did not get a
square deal for the half dozen tickets he bought. They thought
it was a good joke.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Graft of Train Butcher Easy.</span></h4>

<p>In these days if anything gets past the up-to-date train
butcher it isn't because the public knows any more than it
did in Barnum's time. We get a customer every minute by
the birth records.</p>

<p>For a genuine, all-round, dyed-in-the-wool separator of coin
from its proud possessor, the train butcher is the limit. Here
is a word for word story by a train "butch" of how the thing
is done. He excuses his tactics much the same way that the
little rogue does who points out that the giant malefactors are
doing the same thing, but "getting away with it." Enter Mr.
Butch.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I got back yesterday from a two days' trip&mdash;out and in.
I had $29.65 to the good, and the company satisfied, and nary
a kick from the railroad. At one little place down the line,
though, a railroad detective got aboard and tried to detect.</p>

<p>"'Say, young feller,' he said to me, 'I saw you go through
here yesterday lookin' pretty spruce, and I thought I'd better
take a look through yer grips as you came back. What yer
got in there?'</p>

<p>"He kicked my grip, and I opened her up on the minute.
He went through it like an old goat through a cracker barrel,
but he didn't find anything&mdash;see? If he'd looked under the
cushion of a seat in the smoker he might have found a whole
lot of stuff that didn't look like a prayer meeting layout.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">What Was Hidden Under Seat.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Say, I bet I had fourteen $2 gold watches, twenty gold-rimmed
spectacles that cost me 15 cents apiece, one dozen
books, tightly sealed in wrappers, that looked mighty interesting
to the jay who couldn't see into the books, and yet who
had to do it finally at $2 apiece, and, as a topper of it all, my
three-book monte game. Did you ever see the game?</p>

<p>"I've got a line of wild west books about two inches thick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
each, and costing me 40 cents a volume. They've got some
great pictures on the cloth covers, and maybe there's some hot
stuff inside&mdash;I don't know. But here's my unparalleled offer:
I pick out my man and lay these three volumes across his knees
in the car seat and go after him with some of the warmest kind
of air about their interest, the binding, and the illustrations.</p>

<p>"You pay me for the set," I explain, "but in doing it I
give you a chance to get the books for nothing and at the
same time double your investment.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">How Three Book Monte Is Played.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I take out three small, thin spelling books, cloth bound, all
alike as the bindery and the presses can make them. Then,
careless like, I take a $10 bill out of my pocket, fold it across
in a sort of V-shape and slip it into the middle of one of the
spelling books, so that just one corner will stick out, probably
a quarter of an inch. Of course, I haven't seen it! Sometimes
the man on the cars will try to say something about it, but I
cut in and drown him out with easy talk till he gets the idea
that he might as well have that ten and the books for five, and
let it go at that.</p>

<p>"But one corner all the time is torn off that bill, and about
a quarter of an inch of that bill is sticking out of the center
of one of the other books. Of course the jay hasn't seen that!</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Shows Corner of Bill.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Well, I begin and shuffle the books on the payment of the $5.
As they are shuffled the corner of the bill that is still attached
gets turned around next to me, while the corner that is torn off
gets around next to the passenger, whom I have cornered in
the seat in a way that he can't see everything that he really
ought to see in order to save his money. When I hold out the
three books for the drawing I am in a position where I couldn't
possibly see the corner that sticks out, while he is where he
can't see anything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he draws the book with the corner sticking out!</p>

<p>"I take it from him instantly, and hold it up with the bill
corner at the bottom, flipping the leaves through from front
to back and forward again. In the act the corner of the bill
drops out on the floor, where he doesn't see. 'Not here,' I says.
'You made a bad draw. Here's the bill,' I says, taking up the
book that holds it and turning to the $10 bill, just where it lies.
He doesn't know how it all happened, but I console him that
he has the three wild west books for his library when he gets
home.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">All Suckers Not in Day Coaches.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I don't find all these suckers in the day coaches&mdash;not on
your life. I found two pretty boys in the smoking room of a
sleeping car a week ago, and I had $7.50 from one of them and
$5 from the other, and they didn't know a line about it till
they got together after I had gone.</p>

<p>"Friends of mine have kicked because I get $2, or $3, or $4
apiece for gold-rimmed spectacles that cost me $1.80 a dozen.
But where is the kick. I know men who have paid $10 or $15
for glasses from an oculist when the glass was cut out of a
broken window pane. I save such people money, don't I?</p>

<p>"I am not out after the old farmer with hayseed in his hair
and leaf tobacco in his mouth, chewing. There are a lot of
gay chaps traveling these days who think they've got the bulge
on the train butcher by a sort of birthright or something.
They are after me, sometimes, till I can't go to sleep after I
come in from a run. For instance, the other day a chap got
into the train out of a little country town, intending to go to
another little town twenty miles away without change of cars.
He had $2 cash and a guitar when he got on the train, but I
had both when he got off. He wasn't mad at all; he just didn't
understand it. For that reason I'll see him again one of these
days, and he will buck the game harder than he did the first
time. The trouble is he wants to vindicate himself; he's one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of these smart alecs that you couldn't down with a crowbar&mdash;he
don't think!</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Country Town "Sport" Easiest Mark.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Just give me the dead-game sport as he comes from the
country and the country town. He's as good as I want. It's a
sort of charity to take his money away from him before he gets
into real trouble with it. One of them thought he had me the
other day when I tried to sell him a pair of my famous $4
glasses with the gold rims. His had silver, only, but he told me
mine wouldn't show a full moon after dark.</p>

<p>"I asked him to let me see his specs and he handed them
over. I had a bit of wax out of my ear on the tip of my little
finger. I touched each of the glasses with the wax, smearing
them a little with it. That fixed his glasses for good, and don't
forget it. You can't get ear wax off a pair of spectacles with
anything yet invented; it's got a sort of acid that eats into the
glass and won't ever clear up again. The fellow got hot about
it, but I didn't know anything, of course, and finally sold him
a pair of my $1.80 a dozen glasses for $1.50 cash, net.</p>

<p>"O, some people are almost too easy&mdash;I get ashamed of my
calling!"</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Women Victims of Old Coupon Scheme.</span></h4>

<p>There is another moss-grown swindle, which, like hope,
seems to "spring perennial" in the greater cities.</p>

<p>This is the old-time coupon swindle. A suave young man
appears at the door, inserts his foot in the crack, if you try to
slam it in his face, and rapidly begins to explain that he has
something to offer you for nothing. The housewife sighs with
resignation, and admits the suave young man, thinking that
she might as well get it over. But let the housewife herself
talk. Here is the story of a good woman who was caught by
one of these pettifogging grafters:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>"Since my husband died I have partly earned my living by
renting furnished rooms. This seems to be the first thing a
woman thinks of doing when she is left unprovided for, but it
isn't a business of large profits, and few of us ever cut 'melons.'
My furniture, of course, represented my 'plant,' and it was
growing shabby.</p>

<p>"That is, perhaps, why the glib agent got a hearing from
me. He had a lovely proposition. Opening a catalogue he
showed me pictures of beautiful pieces of furniture, made from
expensive materials, just the kind that would make my rooms
attractive and easy to rent.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said he, 'I am soliciting subscriptions for a weekly
paper. This paper will cost you 10 cents a number, and with
each number you get a coupon. When you have accumulated
sixty-eight coupons you can bring them to our wareroom and
select any one of these elegant pieces of furniture.'</p>

<p>"'Why,' said I, 'if these articles are as represented, I couldn't
buy them at any store in town for three times what sixty-eight
coupons would cost me&mdash;$6.80.'</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Old "Wareroom" Tale.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'Call at our wareroom, lady, before you sign the contract,
and you will see they are just as described.'</p>

<p>"Well, I saw the articles, and they were all they were said to
be. They explained that they were practically giving them away
in order to build up the circulation of the paper. Everything
appeared to be all right, and I signed a contract. So did my
widowed sister; so did some of my neighbors.</p>

<p>"The paper was worthless, but I didn't care. Sometimes I
would buy several copies of one issue so as to make haste toward
getting my sixty-eight coupons. The time came when I
went around to select my furniture. I selected it, all right&mdash;a
handsome chiffonier.</p>

<p>"'This chiffonier calls for 360 coupons,' said the man.</p>

<p>"'Why, your agent told me I could have any of these pieces
when I had accumulated sixty-eight coupons,' said I, dismayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"'He couldn't have told you that,' said the man. 'Read your
contract. You will see it says that when you have sixty-eight
coupons you may select any one of these articles, but that
means we will then hold the article for you until you have
paid the rest. Why, we have goods here that call for 600 and
700 coupons.'</p>

<p>"I saw how I had been swindled, and was furious. I told
him what I thought of him and his business, and he offered to
tear up my contract (which, it turned out, bound me to more
than I had dreamed of), if I would pay him an additional $2.50.
I refused. He said he would sue me if I didn't. I told him
to go ahead.</p>

<p>"Shortly afterward a constable served a summons on me to
appear at a justice court at the other end of creation. I didn't
go; and I don't know whether the concern got a judgment
against me or not.</p>

<p>"But I do know I haven't anything to show for the money I
paid for those coupons."</p>
</div>


<h3>BOOK LOVERS EASY PREY OF FRAUDS.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Bogus Art Works Fine Graft.</span></h4>

<p>Some of our citizens are paying a high price for education
in art and book swindles. People, generally, are becoming experts
in detecting small frauds and attacks upon their pocketbooks,
and are becoming wise to pious dodges that run into
spiritualism, clairvoyance and fortune telling, but when a large,
smooth scheme is broached, they get caught. It may be that
we have concentrated our minds upon so many trifling schemes
to part us from our money, that we have laid ourselves bare to
big operators in big frauds like that perpetrated upon the Patten
family of Evanston. The clever fakir reached for $40,000
in an "old book" game and came very near gathering in the pot.
He did get $2,600, which was a very neat job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that there is a wide-spread system under the operations
of which Chicago book lovers, and others all over the country,
have been bilked out of a sum estimated at hundreds of
thousands of dollars. The same system is applied to paintings
by the "old masters," for which some Chicago men have paid
fabulous sums, only to find them imitations. The expert
frauds are geniuses in their peculiar calling, and would deceive
the elect if listened to. A bright, smart, well groomed man
with letters of introduction from high quarters, often forged,
perhaps with a title, breaks into society and bides his time to
make a big haul. The vanity and foibles of the high-steppers
and nobility worshipers are pandered to with masterly skill,
and then a mere suggestion of untold values in books or paintings
is breathed in secret. Do the big fish bite? Some of
them swallow the bait and it has to be cut out of them before
they will give it up. It is becoming so easy to gull some
people, that the crime should consist in the betrayal of innocence
rather than in the successful fraud. While guillible
people continue to parade their guillibility to the world, there
will always be frauds to take advantage of them. If anybody
doubts the fact that people can be easily defrauded, let
him visit any old book store, antique furniture dealer, oriental
rug concern, even junk shops. He will find an amazing
army of faddists, who are willing to pay any exorbitant price
for some cheap fraud because a gentlemanly man, or an opium-smoking
Chinaman, tells him it is the real thing. When business
is dull at the shops, agents visit front doors, back doors,
or invade society with some bogus job of "art" works and realize
enormous sums.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Miserable Little Short Measure Thieves.</span></h4>

<p>In the Municipal Court in South Chicago three extremely
mean swindlers have been fined $25 and costs. It is unfortunate
that they could not have been sent to the Bridewell
without the alternative of paying the fine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>For these swindlers were coal dealers who robbed the poor
that bought coal by the basket. They STOLE money from
their customers, just as the short-measure milk trust conspirators
robbed their patrons. We repeat that they ought to be in
the Bridewell.</p>

<p>Giving short measure is the dirtiest, smallest, most cowardly
form of commercial rascality. The hold-up man who takes his
life in his hand and robs on the public highway is a model of
decency and courage as compared with the pitiful rascal who
steals the pennies of the poor by selling coal or milk or any
other necessity of life by short weight.</p>

<p>Short weight is larceny. It ought to be treated as larceny
by law.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Crime a Fine Art.</span></h4>

<p>Living by one's wits has become a fine art, and it is a profession
that is more liberally patronized than any other by the
present generation. One of America's leading detectives remarked
that there were about seventy-five thousand people in
a city the size of Chicago that would bear watching. There
isn't a bank, insurance office, dry goods store, restaurant or
hotel that does not employ men to watch their customers, and
there is hardly a business house in the country that has not
some system of watching its employes. Everybody at this day
seems to be afraid of everybody else.</p>

<p>Professional criminals pride themselves quite as much upon
their ability as men engaged in legitimate occupations. A
thief, for instance, is as vain of his superiority over other
thieves as a lawyer, politician, or clergyman might be whose
talents had elevated him to a commanding position in the
eyes of the people. And the talented thief is as much courted
and sought after as the successful man in the honest walks
of life. The other thieves will say: "He is a good man to
know; I must make his acquaintance." But the thief who has
earned a reputation is particular about the company he keeps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and is scornful in his demeanor toward another thief whom
he does not consider his professional equal. Caste exists among
criminals as well as among other classes.</p>

<p>Men and women who are not living merely for today must be
deeply interested in the efforts which practical philanthropists
are making to discover the causes of crime and to remedy the
mischievous conditions which now prevail to such an alarming
extent. Hidden away to a considerable degree in the great
mass of figures which came into being through the operations
of the census bureau, are facts that should shock every good
citizen. With all the warmth of eulogy the story of wonderful
progress has been told again and again, but only a few references
have been made to the abnormal growth of what may be
termed by the criminal class. Forty years ago there was but
one criminal to 3,500 good or reasonably good citizens. According
to the last census the proportion was one in 786.5,
an increase of 445 per cent in a period during which the population
increased but 170 per cent. Never in the nation's history
has educational work of all descriptions been nearly so
active as at present, yet the increase in the number of those
who were confined in penitentiaries and jails and reformatory
institutions is almost twice as rapid as the growth of population.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Cities Breeding Spots of Crime.</span></h4>

<p>The true explanation of this unsatisfactory state of things
is not far to seek. It is almost entirely to be attributed to the
growing tendency of the community to become concentrated
in large cities. A highly concentrated population fosters lawless
and immoral instincts in such a multitude of ways that
it is only an expression of literal exactitude to call the great
cities of today the nurseries of modern crime. Statistics of
all kinds show this, but it can easily be ascertained without
the aid of any figures. The aggregation of large multitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
within a very limited area must increase the chances of conflict,
and consequently multiply the occasions for crime.</p>

<p>A population in this crowded condition has also to be restrained
and regulated at every turn by a huge network of
laws, and as every new law forbids something which was permitted
before, a multiplication of laws is inevitably followed
by an increase of crime.</p>

<p>The prevention of crime should be the great object with the
philanthropist. The obvious remedy is, if possible, to aid the
individual in overcoming the temptation to evil or to crime.
The remedy must be general, gradual, and constant. It consists
in religious, moral, intellectual, and industrial education
of the children, especially of the poor and unfortunate and the
weakling classes. The most certain preventive is the early incarnation
of good habits in children, which, becoming part and
parcel of their nervous organization, are an unconscious force
when passion, perplexity, or temptation tend to make them
lose self-control. Little can be expected from palliative remedies
for social diseases so long as this educational remedy is
not thoroughly carried out.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">America's Educated Criminal Class.</span></h4>

<p>The great mass of the American people, aside from those
who have had experience in hunting and shadowing criminals,
labor under the popular delusion that the most daring criminals
of today are a lot of tough, ignorant men, with little or
no education at all, who would do almost anything else than
work honestly for a living. If people would but stop to consider
the subject a moment they would readily discover their
error. There are, it is true, a large number of swindlers,
thieves, pickpockets, thugs and criminals of a like class who
have but a scant knowledge of books, or literature, but they are
only to be found among the lower class of criminals. The most
notorious criminals the world has ever produced have been men
and women of high culture and refinement, well educated and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
thoroughly posted on all that is transpiring. It is this class
of people who make the most successful, and at the same time
most dangerous, criminals. It requires men of education to
swindle, crack a safe, rob a bank, jewelry store or forge a paper.
To be a successful confidence operator requires the man to be
well educated in matters of all kinds, to be a fluent talker, a
person of refinement and polite address, and a good judge of
character.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Refined Criminals Most Dangerous.</span></h4>

<p>Criminal history shows that the most successful jobs are
always planned and executed by men of education; the details
of some of the great forgeries that have taken place, of the
numerous bank robberies and burglar's exploits, all go to show
the direction of a brain of no ordinary person, being proof
positive that the persons planning the work possessed both
education and talent. First class criminals are exceedingly
hard to cope with, and are the most dangerous to handle by
the officers. They do not generally do things in a rush or by
halves. Great care is given to all the minor details of their
work, and it often takes weeks and months before they are
ready to put their plans into operation. They study all the
possibilities of the job; the chances of success, and the way of
escape in case of failure; how they can cover all traces of the
work and throw the guilt or suspicion upon the more unfortunate
of their class who have had reputations and who are
likely to be brought up and possibly convicted on suspicion of
being the guilty parties. Educated crooks are always to be
feared, not only by the public against whom they are constantly
devising ways and means to relieve of their valuables, but by
detectives of a lesser grade. This class of crooks do not hesitate
to sacrifice the detective if their desired ends can be
successfully accomplished, while the detective finds it a task
of no little moment to gain even the faintest clue to their
operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prison Poor Cure for Crime.</span></h4>

<p>Locking a man up for committing a crime does not always
cure him. It is now proven that affixed penalties to certain
crimes accomplishes practically nothing, for it is based on a
wrong principle. The length of confinement ought, confessedly,
to be adjusted to the needs of the prisoner. He should not be
discharged from his moral hospital until there is reasonable
assurance that he is cured. He certainly should not be turned
loose on society, on the mere expiration of a formal sentence,
when it is known he will begin anew on his old life. Protection
to society, as well as the reformation of the criminal, call
for the retention of the latter until he can be trusted with his
liberty, and affords proof that he is fitted to take his place in
the world as a useful, law-abiding citizen. This system alone
permits the fullest scope to reformatory methods, and leaves
to the court the right of sentencing indefinitely, and to the
tribunal which has to do with the prisoner's release, to say
when there is reasonable ground for faith that if discharged
he will not prove either a burden or menace to society. Where
conduct and character afford no such grounds he should be incarcerated
for life, just as we would retain hopeless lunatics
in asylums.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Maconochie's Experiment.</span></h4>

<p>This form of sentence was first put into operation in a modified
form by Maconochie, at Norfolk Island, in 1836, with a
success in the way of reformatory results from the start which
was unequalled. Now the best authorities in penology in all
countries not only commend it, but the opinion is fast becoming
general that it is a necessary feature in every reformatory
system of prison discipline. Of course it implies in prison
management the highest wisdom and integrity, and especially
the banishment of partisan politics therefrom. It makes the
dominant idea of prison administration manhood-making, and
not money-making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Faces Portray Character.</span></h4>

<p>Every one knows that men's passions, propensities, and peculiarities,
as well as their calling, are reflected in their faces.</p>

<p>It is as impossible to disguise a face as a handwriting.
When the expert comes the disguise is torn off and the face
tells the true story of the spirit inside the body. One only
needs to visit the penitentiary to realize how undeniably vice
writes its sign manual on the features. It is not the drunkard
only whose red nose, flabby cheeks and rheumy eyes betray him;
it is the senualist whose vice is read in his lips, the knave whose
propensity is revealed in the shape of his mouth; the man of
violence is surrendered by his eyes. An experienced detective
policeman, or a trained jailer seldom needs to ask the crime of
which the prisoner was guilty. He can tell it by his face.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that in the future the study of physiognomy
is going to be pursued more vigorously than it has been.
As a means of preventing crime it may prove invaluable. How
constantly do we hear of men "falling from grace," as the
phrase goes. Yet these men must have carried their crime in
their faces for a long time. If any one had been able to read
their features the mischief might have been averted. It is well
known that every man's face is more or less stamped by the
pursuit he follows. An experienced observer can generally
detect a lawyer, or a doctor, or a merchant, or a clerk, or a
mechanic, or a clergyman, by merely studying his face.</p>

<p>The instinctive criminal is a social parasite. The conclusion
is irresistible that he is organically morbid. He will proceed
to any extreme, and life and property, separating him from the
accomplishment of his wishes, are but barriers to be overcome.
The occasional criminal is largely a negative creature, who
yields himself when temptation and the stimulus of opportunity
exceed his resistive power. The habitual and professional criminal
represents degree rather than kind. Criminality is to him
a profession, a fine art, and susceptible of division into specialties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Criminal Heads Not Extraordinary.</span></h4>

<p>The average heads of criminals and those of ordinary people
probably do not vary much in size. A large brain does not
necessarily indicate great intelligence any more than a small
one mental deficiencies, this being true, as little importance
can be attached to the weight of brains of criminals. The
weight of Oliver Cromwell's brain was 82.29 ounces; Lord
Byron's, 79 ounces; Cuvier's, 64 ounces; Ruloff's (a thief and
murderer), 59 ounces; adult idiot's, 54.95 ounces; Daniel Webster's,
53.50 ounces, and Gambetta's, that of the size of a
microcephalic idiot.</p>

<p>A face may either attract or repel; its lines indicate firmness
and decision, or weakness and sensuousness. In physiognomy
may be traced fineness or brutality, surfeit or privation,
gentleness or irascibility; yet from a consideration of the face
it is assuming too much to predicate the form of criminal tendencies,
if any, on the subject. Criminal physiognomy is not
yet an exact science. The practical criminologist regards criminality
as bred in the bone and born in the flesh, and the ethology
of crime to be looked for chiefly is in heredity and environment,
using the word environment in its most liberal sense, ante and
post-natal, and whatever cause, in whatever way, that exerts a
deleterious influence upon nutrition and the functions of organic
life, voluntary and involuntary.</p>

<p>Little is being done in this country in criminal anthropology
that can compare with the studies and researches that are being
carried on in Italy, France, and Germany. The student unacquainted
with the language of these countries pursues his
studies at a disadvantage, owing to the paucity of literature in
English upon the subject.</p>

<p>The tide of crime is steadily rising. The level of criminality,
it is well known, is rising, and has been rising during the
whole of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries, throughout
the civilized world. Its prevention and cure is a perplexing
study, and is engaging the thoughts and energies of the best
intellects of the world.</p>

<p>RATHER THAN SEEK GREAT PROFITS WITHOUT

<p>NO MAN WILL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR FOR FIFTY
CENTS&mdash;UNLESS THE DOLLAR IS COUNTERFEIT.</p>

<p>DO NOT PAY OUT YOUR OWN GOOD MONEY FOR
ANOTHER MAN'S BOGUS DOLLARS.</p>

<p>IF THE PROMOTER COULD DO ONE-HALF OF WHAT
HE CLAIMS, HE WOULD NOT NEED YOUR MONEY,
BUT SOON WOULD BE RICH BEYOND THE DREAMS
OF AVARICE.</p>

<p>DO NOT INVEST YOUR HARD-WON SAVINGS IN
VANISHING AIR CASTLES.</p>

<p>PROMISES WHICH PROCEED FROM A DESIRE TO
GET YOUR MONEY ALWAYS MERIT SUSPICION. SUBJECT
THEM TO THE MOST CAREFUL AND RIGID EXAMINATION.</p>

<p>ADOPT THE BANKER'S RULE THAT: "ALL MEN
SHOULD BE REGARDED AS DISHONEST UNTIL THEIR
HONESTY IS PROVED," RATHER THAN THE SUCKER'S
THEORY THAT "ALL MEN ARE HONEST."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

SMALL CHANGE TO THE INVESTMENT BROKER
WHO OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RISK A

<p>WHEN A MAN TRIES TO HURRY YOU INTO SPENDING
YOUR MONEY PUT IT BACK IN YOUR POCKET
AND KEEP YOUR HAND ON IT.</p>

<p>USE CAUTION, REASON AND COMMON SENSE.</p>

<p>DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM
DO UNTO YOU. MOST OTHERS WILL "DO" YOU IF

<p>IF YOU ARE MARKED AS ONE OF THE GEESE

THEY WILL SEND YOU LITERATURE
THROUGH THE MAILS. SAVE EVERY CIRCULAR,

POSTOFFICE INSPECTOR IN THE TOWN FROM
WHICH THEY WERE SENT.</p>

<p>BE SURE TO SEND THE ENVELOPES WITH THE<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
LITERATURE AS THE COMMUNICATIONS CANNOT
BE ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE UNLESS THE ORIGINAL
WRAPPERS OR ENVELOPES IN WHICH THEY WERE
MAILED ARE OFFERED WITH THEM. THE POSTMASTER
WILL INSTRUCT HOW TO FORWARD THE
COMPLAINT.</p>

<p>PROSECUTION OF THE SWINDLERS WILL SURELY
FOLLOW.</p>

<p>IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT ABOUT THE CHARACTER
OF THE CONCERN WHICH INVITES YOU TO INVEST
YOUR MONEY, CONSULT A LAWYER, BANKER OR
REPUTABLE COMMERCIAL AGENCY.</p>

<p>Intending investors should remember that:</p>

<p>"SURE TIPS" are sure bait for sure fools.</p>

<p>When you hear stocks have gone up and men who
bought them cheap have sold them at high prices and
gained fortunes suspect your informant. If he seeks to
induce you to invest be assured he is a GET-RICH-QUICK
grafter.</p>

<p>Many swindlers wear the garb of respectability; they
even cloak their rascality with piety. Many men accepted
by the world as honorable members of society spend their
lives living on the credulity of the ignorant, and when
they die go to the grave followed by hordes of dupes who
mourn their end.</p>

<p>These swindlers await you at every turn; on the race-track;
in the saloon; with the poker deck and the ivory
dice; with watered stock and fraudulent bonds; with
prayers on their lips and designs in their minds to defraud
you.</p>

<p>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN HONEST GAMBLER.</p>

<p>Every gambling game is a dishonest scheme. You seek
to get the other man's money without giving him anything
in return.</p>

<p>You are not entitled to one penny unless you give value
in return. If you are in business you know that every
promissory note, to be valid, must bear on its face two
words, "value received."</p>

<p>INDUSTRY, ENERGY, THRIFT! These are the dice
that win. The lesson is hard to learn for the young.</p>

<p>He has anxious days and feverish nights who risks at
chance what should be devoted to the nobler ends of life;
who "makes throws" on the green cloth; who watches the
snake-like tape squirm out of the ticker; or gazes at a
bunch of horses running around a ring.</p>

<p>GIVE IT ALL UP AND ADOPT HONEST MEANS OF
PROCURING WEALTH!</p>

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of these sayings will strike you as very old and lacking
in novelty. But, old as these rules are, human beings have not
yet learned to follow them. And they won't learn for many a
long year.</p>

<p>We shall not moralize about them all today, only one or two
we want to emphasize.</p>

<p>"Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly."</p>

<p>If you work willingly, if you make yourself realize that willing
effort is easy, AND THE ONLY KIND THAT MAKES
YOU GROW AND SUCCEED, you will solve one of your big
working problems.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a small boy walking ahead of a band, with
the music playing?</p>

<p>And did you ever see the same small boy walking half the distance
to get a newspaper for his father? Walking with the
band rests him; it doesn't tire him at all, BECAUSE HE DOES
IT WILLINGLY. And the other kind of walking takes the
very heart out of him and makes him almost too tired to eat
his dinner.</p>

<p>It is exactly that way with all the work we do in this world.
When you do things willingly, with the heart and the nerves and
the brain acting with one another cheerfully, work is easy AND
SUCCESS FOLLOWS.</p>

<p>A willing FOOL may lag behind an unwilling man of intelligence.
But even a willing fool is happier in the end than an
unwilling one, and, all things being even, the employe working
WILLINGLY will cease being an employe and have others
working for him sooner than the other man.</p>

<h3>PRIDE COSTS MORE THAN HUNGER, THIRST AND COLD.</h3>

<p>This applies to all kinds of foolish vanity. It applies to the
young man who never does anything, BECAUSE HE IS TOO
PROUD TO DO WHAT HE HAS THE CHANCE TO DO.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>It applies to men and women who squander on dress and
show the money that they need for more serious purposes.</p>

<p>It applies to those that in old age have no money saved up,
BECAUSE PRIDE SPENT THEIR MONEY AS FAST AS
THEY GOT IT.</p>

<p>The pride that keeps men honest, the pride that makes men
truthful, never kept a man back or hurt him.</p>

<p>The bad kind of pride is the pride which can be described as
"the coward's pride." Men are foolishly and cowardly proud
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT OTHER MEN
WILL THINK. Money that they cannot afford they spend
helping other men to drink too much, BECAUSE THEY ARE
ASHAMED TO BE THOUGHT STINGY OR MEAN.</p>

<p>Men squander in keeping up appearances money that should
be saved for another day, for a good business opportunity, because
they are too cowardly to be guided by their own judgment,
and ignore what others may THINK about them.</p>

<p>Self-respect is one thing; foolish pride, vanity, moral cowardice,
are very different. Get rid of them.</p>

<p>All the advice from these 20 rules is good advice. The man
who can keep his temper while he thinks&mdash;whether he count ten
or a million&mdash;is a lucky man.</p>

<p>A man in a rage is a man whose BRAIN IS NO LONGER
WORKING. And the man whose brain isn't working is at the
mercy of the man whose brain IS working.</p>

<p>Worry about the FUTURE troubles is a curse with many
men. It prevents their working well TODAY.</p>

<p>Overeating, and especially eating at the wrong time, is a great
evil in this country. If men would learn to eat heartily only
when their day's work is done, WHEN THEIR MINDS MUST
NO LONGER BE CONCENTRATED, THEY WILL SAVE
THEIR STOMACHS AND ACCOMPLISH TWICE THE
AMOUNT OF WORK IN THEIR LIVES.</p>

<p>Read these rules over, and moralize on them for yourselves
and for your children.</p>

<p>We have seen the Matrimonial Agency sweep the whole range
of the world of crime from the petty thieving of a Carson to
the almost unbelievable horrors of the Gunness Farm.</p>

<p>And this monster is hydra-headed. Stamp it out in one
place and it immediately reappears in another. Send a "manager"
to prison once, twice, ten times, and the minute the
prison doors are open he is back at the old stand doing business.</p>

<p>Something of the tremendous efforts being put forth to
stamp out this evil may be gained from the headlines of this
story, where the strenuous work of Detective Wooldridge of
Chicago is summarized.</p>

<p>Chicago has been and is today infested by a formidable community
of matrimonial agencies who invade all ranks of life.
They promote many specious schemes to lure the elusive dollar
from the pockets of unwary victims. These operatives are
sharp, smooth and unscrupulous&mdash;the most dangerous of
criminal perverts.</p>

<p>Were the census enumerators of the United States to compile
a list of the "sucker" public the gullible ones would aggregate
tens of millions. There is not a township in this great nation
that does not contain its portion of confiding persons who are
ready to believe anything, from the rankest catch-penny advertisement
to a fallacy in theological dogma.</p>

<p>They are willing to open up their hearts to unknown matrimonially
inclined correspondents; to accept as gospel the incredible
statements of impostors and to pay out money gained
by hard toil for something which the reason of a child should
tell them it is beyond the power of man to provide.</p>

<p>They are easy prey alike to religious and political impostors
and unscrupulous adventurers. Investigations for years past
into the innermost secrets of swindlers, and the observations
incidental to official experience disclosing how victims are
drawn into the net of the grafter, impel the belief that the
faith of many persons passes beyond the bounds of credulity
into the domain of imbecility.</p>

<p>Men and women who are engaged in promoting matrimonial
agencies are guilty of crime. It is opposed to the fundamental
principles of society. Such a practice should under no circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
be tolerated. It is inconsistent with the highest ideals
of what should constitute the proper marriage relations.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Human Derelicts Are Dupes.</span></h4>

<p>Human derelicts of a low mental caliber are the dupes of
these matrimonial agencies. Few people know that such
schemes as these are carried out. Few know that advertisements
by men of wealth, women of culture and pretty widows
who seek matrimonial alliances are merely means by which
scoundrels get a revenue.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Matrimonial Agents' Methods.</span></h4>

<p>To describe adequately the technicalities of the marriage
agencies and bureau swindlers' methods would be impossible
without presenting actual copies of documents necessary to the
system. Early in the investigations the discovery was made
that the scores of matrimonial agencies, "introduction bureaux"
and "marriage clubs" were using practically the same
literature. Few departed from the stereotyped plan for "pulling
the suckers on." For the most part the prospectuses and
"follow-up" letters were identical.</p>

<p>As often happened, however, when a victim was "landed
right" and ventured to Chicago from his distant rural retreat
prepared to carry out in earnest the game that had been worked
upon him in a spirit of mercenary recklessness, the methods of
handling him were varied in respect to both finesse and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Any person familiar with the uses of the typewriter easily
could have discovered that the "personal" letters received from
time to time were nothing more than circulars printed by the
thousands. So vast was the number of the gullible that seldom,
if ever, was an actual, bona fide letter sent in reply to those
from the victims.</p>

<p>Space was left at the top of the stock letters for the insertion
of the name of the person to whom it was sent. In their haste
the swindlers often begrudged the time necessary to change the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
"Dear Sir" to "Dear Miss" or "Dear Madam" when a woman
was addressed on stationery intended for male clients.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Notice! She's engaged but
engagements have been broken so hurry before the wedding bells have
rung.... Going! Going! Third and Last Call!</span></div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">No Trust Here.</span></h4>

<p>The general uniformity of the literature was at first thought
by me to indicate that the matrimonial agencies were banded
together in a gigantic trust. But later I learned that as they
increased in number the newcomers exhibited conscienceless
audacity in copying the forms used by their predecessors. It
was also found in some cases several matrimonial agencies
were operated from one address and one or two men, or a man
and his wife would represent half a dozen concerns by changing
names and locations every thirty or sixty days. Because
of these facts and the added fact that whoever compiled the
original forms from which the others copied, realized, he was in
an illegitimate business, the plagiarists were never prosecuted.
Thus the buncombe administered to the suckers became uniform
in phraseology.</p>

<p>If a person desired to make assurance doubly sure for gaining
wealth and marital bliss and he applied to several agencies
at the same time, the same mail would bring him letters from
each matrimonial agency with which he communicated, worded
identically. They would be mimeograph copies, and the only
difference in their appearance would be in the printed heading
indicating the name of the agency. The name of the recipient
would often be written at the top in ink different in color from
the body of the letter.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Working the Double Cross.</span></h4>

<p>The usual beginning is a small subscription fee paid for a
"matrimonial" paper. This paper contains alleged descriptions
of men and women, principally the latter, who are claimed
by the publisher to be seeking wives or husbands through the
matrimonial agency. The subscriber who becomes interested
in any of the descriptions is made to pay a fee for more detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
information and alleged record of the financial circumstances
of the person. There is sometimes an additional fee
for a photograph. This picture may or may not be one of
the person described, but that matters little. Almost any old
photograph will serve the purpose. In all the raids made on
matrimonial agencies collections of photographs have been
found.</p>

<p>That tens of thousands of otherwise intelligent men and
women should either entrust pictures of themselves to an
agency by which it is to be sent out to unknown persons, or
should even begin such negotiations as those carried on through
the matrimonial agency, is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The money derived in the aggregate from subscriptions to
the matrimonial paper, the fees for particulars and those for
photographs and miscellaneous "services" amount to large
sums. With many of the agencies the services stop at this point,
but many others undertake personal introductions of lonesome
maids and widows to the invariably "honest and affectionate"
bachelors and widowers, and when this is done there are other
fees, depending altogether on how much the victims appear
to be willing to stand.</p>

<p>A large number have been found and suppressed in which
there was but one lonesome maid or widow and one honest
and affectionate bachelor or widower, the former being the
woman accomplice of the manager of the agency and the latter
the manager himself. They answer love-lorn correspondents
of both sexes and select for victims those believed to have the
most money. If the assistant to the manager is posing as the
possible bride in the case the wife hunter must make satisfactory
settlements with the manager for conducting the negotiations,
and this amount, with that which the accomplice is
able to secure from the victim, amounts often to a considerable
sum. After the victim is separated from his money something
happens to prevent the happy conclusion of the marriage
negotiations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Two Well-Defined Forms.</span></h4>

<p>There are two well-defined forms of the "matrimonial agent."
The one is the man who openly runs an agency, who advertises
"golden-haired young ladies, worth half a million dollars,"
"blue-eyed widows of languishing temperaments" and "wealthy
farmers." It is through this class of "bureau" that the great
crimes of the matrimonial business have been engineered. Hoch,
Mrs. Gunness, Holmes and other arch-criminals made good
use of this type.</p>

<p>The other type is just the plain swindler. The man who
works along the secondary lines, as they may be called, would
scorn to be a matrimonial agent. He is either a reverend gentleman
of the cloth, a minister to whom some languishing
widow is looking for spiritual direction, and he thinks that she
"needs she should get married," to quote the East Side phraseology;
or he is a lawyer who has a wealthy client, who, not
being a business woman, is incapable of running her own affairs,
and he again thinks of marriage as a solution; or, again,
he is "an employment agency." This secondary type is generally
a cheap sort, grafting on the gullible for five or ten dollars,
or even as high as $100.</p>


<h3>CONCRETE EXAMPLES.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Type No. 1.</span></h4>

<p>September 8, 1905, John H. Harris, 168 Hamlin avenue,
editor and publisher of The Pilot, a marriage agency paper,
and manager of a cheap mail order house, was raided and arrested
by Detective Wooldridge.</p>

<p>Among the letters seized were complaints from his patrons.
They received no returns for money paid him, and averred his
paper was being used to blackmail men and women. Complaints
were also made that many of the names which appeared
in the paper were not authorized, and other names
attached to the order were forgeries.</p>

<p>The following is the copy of a letter dated September 1,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
1906, and is only one among hundreds of others sent out by
the thousands by Harris. Many more thousands were sent
through the mail to his sub-agents, who worked on a commission.
This agent employed other agents, who started an endless
chain by copying the letter and having the friends do
likewise.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="author">Chicago. Ill., Sept. 1, 1905.
</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>We have a very recent application from a brown-eyed widow
of 41, medium size, musical, has no children. She informs us
that she has recently come into possession of a fortune of
over FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS, and that
she wishes to marry an honest, affectionate gentleman. We
also have a recent application from a pretty, blue-eyed lady of
20, who estimates her present means at FORTY THOUSAND
DOLLARS, and her inheritance at twenty thousand dollars.
Her form is graceful, her education good, her disposition gentle
and she desires a steady, honest husband. We believe she
would start her husband in business. And to accommodate
those ladies and quickly find a husband for them we make the
following SPECIAL OFFER:</p>

<p>Fill out the coupon at the bottom, and send it to us with
one dollar (and six postage stamps) and enclose a sealed and
stamped letter to either or both of the ladies referred to above.
We will immediately mail your letter to the lady or ladies,
and place your name on our books, and send you a certificate
of membership for six months, and send you the full names
and addresses of the handsome widow of means, and the handsome
blue-eyed maiden of means, and also send you a list
of names and addresses of other ladies of means and otherwise.
And until you are married, or until the end of six
months, we will, on or about the first of each month, mail you
a list of descriptions, names and addresses of ladies of means
and otherwise, without application from you or any expense
to you. We have good reason to believe that either of the
ladies mentioned above would make you a good wife, but if
they do not meet your approval you can select one who will
from the stream of ladies of means and otherwise who are constantly
requesting us to secure husbands for them, which enables
us to introduce you to those whom you would be pleased
to meet with a view to marriage.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

</div>

<p>United States Inspector of Mails at Chicago Postoffice R.
W. McAfee compelled John H. Harris to furnish him with
the names and addresses of the two women heiresses who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
worth $40,000 and $500,000, respectively, who were just dying
for the want of a good, kind husband to spend their money
for them, and were seeking marriage through his paper and
matrimonial agency.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Harris gave the name of Mrs. H. R. Adams, at Huntington,
Md., as the $40,000 woman and Jennie Ziehler, Lawrence,
Mass., as the $500,000 woman. Upon investigation
it was found that neither of the women was worth a dollar.
The $500,000 woman was in the insane asylum.</p>

<p>This letter, together with The Pilot, marriage paper and its
printed advertisements, was plainly intended to draw the unwary
and deprive the ignorant of their savings.</p>

<p>John H. Harris then appealed to ex-Mayor Edward F.
Dunne of Chicago, under the alias of A. Ingird, taxpayer,
citizen and reputable business man, to have Detective Wooldridge
stopped from further interfering with him or his business.
Men who operate these frauds pretend to be honest and
high-minded; by constant practice of their wiles upon others
they develop self-deception and come to believe in their own
honesty to such an extent that when questioned they assume a
good counterfeit of honest indignation.</p>

<p>Mayor Dunne upon investigation learned the large mass of
evidence gathered, and ordered the investigation to go forward,
which, resulted in the arrest and holding over of John H.
Harris to the Grand Jury.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Commits Suicide.</span></h4>

<p>These complaints and evidence were turned over to Colonel
James Stuart, Chief Inspector of the Mails at the Chicago
Postoffice, for further investigation. A fraud order was requested.
On August 18, 1907, Mr. Harris committed suicide
by blowing out his brains at 168 N. Hamlin avenue, Chicago,
Illinois, after the mask had been pulled off and his methods
exposed.</p>

<p>One is unable to state whether John H. Harris is opening
a mail order house, paper and marriage agency in the other
world. When he left he did not leave word where he would
make his next stop, but if he went to the other world, we are
not informed that wireless telegraph or balloon companies have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
as yet perfected the lines of transportation or communication.</p>

<p>Harris is a fairly representative and concrete expression of
the regulation matrimonial agent. It was through such
agencies as his that the great crimes eventually were pulled off.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Secondary Types.</span></h4>

<p>But in the following letters we have an excellent example of
the second type, the little grafter who wants anything you can
give, from $5 to $100. From the text of the letters it will
be observed that this man was operating as a minister, a lawyer
and an employment agency at one and the same time, as the
letters are all from one source.</p>

<p>In the case of the lawyer this scoundrel was trading upon
the name of Edward H. Morris, one of the foremost colored
attorneys of the United States, a man universally respected
and admired by men in all walks of life. When the fact of
this trading on his name was brought to the real attorney's
attention he was furious, and he cheerfully gave all the assistance
in his power to Detective Wooldridge.</p>

<p>This smooth one was afterward arrested in New Orleans,
convicted and sent to prison for a term.</p>

<p>Here follows the text of the letters:</p>

<span class="smcap">Mr. O. W. Zink</span>,<br />

</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>For many years I have been a MINISTER of the GOSPEL
and during that time I have not only performed hundreds of
marriages, but have arranged many, and there are at the
present time among my acquaintances some half dozen wealthy
ladies, ranging in age from twenty to forty or fifty years, one
of whom is the handsome widow whose photo I enclose herewith.</p>

<p>She is worth, in actual cash and negotiable securities, fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
$50,000, inherited from her worthy husband, who departed
this life a year ago and, as she is without friends, relatives
or children, her physician, a friend of mine, has on account
of her utter loneliness advised her to marry, believing that
marriage and change of scene will prove for her a blessing in
disguise, and naturally she has turned to me, her spiritual
adviser, in whom she has the utmost confidence. I have several
times talked the matter over with her, and, knowing that
she is very much averse to advertising, I have undertaken to
introduce to her some gentleman who would make her a good
husband, and to arrange a marriage for her.</p>

<p>As her physician thinks it advisable for her to reside elsewhere
than Chicago, I have been somewhat perplexed as to
how to secure for her a suitable introduction and in my
dilemma consulted a matrimonial agency and, after several
conferences with them, I have decided to submit for your kind
consideration my proposition and manner of procedure. I
have studied the matter carefully, have gone thoroughly into
your description and instructions as filed with the agency of
which you are a member, and in my mind there is not the
slightest doubt as to you two proving mutually suitable to
each other. Of course, you cannot form the proper idea of her
from the small photo enclosed, but in age, appearance, circumstances,
etc., she is just what you have been seeking in a wife.</p>

<p>She is in every respect a thoroughly good woman, unusually
bright and intelligent, but knows nothing of business, and
is in absolute need of a husband to look after her affairs,
but, TO BE CANDID WITH YOU, I am getting along in
years, and have a large family to support and as I only arrange
a few marriages at intervals, I must necessarily have
compensation adequate to the service I render.</p>

<p>Now, I can, by recommending you personally, cause her to
enter into a correspondence with you that will undoubtedly
lead to your marriage, if you are still desirous of such a
marriage, as I presume you are, from the fact that you are
registered with a matrimonial agency. I will, for the consideration
of $100, introduce you to her by letter and after
you have exchanged three or four letters, will have you visit
her at her expense, as you may mutually agree, if you will
follow my simple instructions.</p>

<p>I am not making you this proposition on the spur of the
moment, for I have spent much time and thought before deciding
to write you, and all I ask is that, AS AN EVIDENCE
OF YOUR GOOD FAITH and to cover the immediate expense
necessary thereto on my part (such as asking her to
dinner with me a few times in order that I may during the
good cheer that abounds at such times dwell at length upon
the matter without any unnecessary delay), that you enclose
me immediately upon receipt of this letter BANK DRAFT,
REGISTERED LETTER, or EXPRESS MONEY ORDER,
for $10; the balance, $90, you need not pay me until after
you have married her and assumed the management of her
affairs. Upon receipt of this small amount, $10, I will absolutely
guarantee your marriage to her within sixty days and,
if before that time you should feel that you do not care to
pursue the matter to a conclusion, I will positively refund
your money upon my honor as a MINISTER OF THE
GOSPEL.</p>

<p>My standing in my profession is such that I could not do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
otherwise and, as I have stated before, there are several ladies
to whom I could introduce you, now that I have really taken
the matter up with you, but I consider you two really suited
to each other, so will not go into further particulars. Trusting
to hear from you AT THE VERY EARLIEST POSSIBLE
MOMENT, I am, with assurance of my regards,</p>

<span class="smcap">Mr. Geo. Ferlin</span>,<br />

</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I have during my professional career arranged many marriages
for ladies of means, and at the present time have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
among my clients some ten or twelve wealthy ladies, ranging
in age from twenty-five to fifty years, desirous of marriage,
one of whom is the charming widow whose likeness I herewith
enclose.</p>

<p>She is worth $60,000 ($25,000 in ready cash, the balance in
high-class tangible property inherited from her mother, recently
deceased). She is alone and childless and her physician, on
account of her bereavement, has recommended a marriage and
change of scene, and in her dilemma she has consulted me, her
legal adviser, and I, in turn, without her knowledge, appealed
to a matrimonial agency with which I have for several years
had business relations in a professional way.</p>

<p>Out of the several names submitted to me I have, after
much thought and deliberation, selected yours, and I beg that
you will consider carefully my proposition and the fact that
I am not in business for my health, but for revenue, together
with a desire to please my clients and to give them
value received.</p>

<p>This lady, while unusually bright and intelligent, knows
little of the ways of the world, and nothing of business, and,
to be candid with you, needs a husband to manage her estates,
and I can, by recommending you personally, cause her, through
me as her attorney, to open negotiations with you for a marriage;
so if you desire a wealthy wife, as I presume you do
from the fact that you are registered with a matrimonial
agency, I will, for the consideration of $100 introduce you
to her, have you visit her at her expense, as you may mutually
agree, and will absolutely guarantee your marriage to her
within sixty days, if you will follow my instructions to the
letter.</p>

<p>All that I ask is, as an evidence of your good faith and to
cover the immediate clerical expenses necessary thereto, you
enclose me immediately upon receipt of this letter, BANK
DRAFT OR MONEY ORDER for $10, the balance ($90)
to be paid after marriage, and when I have caused her to
place in your hands, or under your control, a goodly portion
of her worldly possessions.</p>

<p>Now, if you wish to accept my proposition, enclose me immediately
the small retaining fee ($10) and promise me that
you will follow carefully my instructions; otherwise do not
write me, as I positively will not enter into further correspondence
until you have engaged me as your attorney upon
the lines I have laid down.</p>

<p>If before the end of sixty days you feel that you do not
care to pursue the matter to a conclusion I will refund your
money. My standing as an attorney is ample evidence that
I will faithfully carry out my contract. Remember that I
have among my clients, as I have stated before, ten or twelve
wealthy ladies to my certain knowledge desirous of marriage.</p>

<p>Now, my dear sir, if you really mean business and really
want to marry the charming and wealthy young widow in question,
I see no earthly reason why you should hesitate for a
single instant to retain my services in connection with this matter.
You may give me good references, and I can give you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
same, but that has no bearing on the case whatever. I cannot,
as stated, do any business with you until you first enclose me
this small retaining fee, as I must be in a position to truthfully
state that you are my friend and client.</p>

<p>You may have had unfortunate dealings with matrimonial
agencies, but as an attorney in high standing, I am not to be
compared with such concerns, and on receipt of your small
retaining fee, I will guarantee to do my part and arrange a
speedy marriage if you adhere strictly to my instructions.</p>

<p>
Trusting to hear favorably from you at once, I am,</p>

<p class="author">Yours very truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">Edward Morris</span>.
</p>

<p>P. S. I do not ask for the balance of the $100 until after
your marriage, and I have caused the lady to place in your
hands or under your control a goodly portion of her worldly
possessions.</p>

</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Your favor at hand with enclosure accepting my proposition.
Now, I wish to assure you that everything you write to
me will be treated in the strictest confidence, and I will say
that it will be necessary for you to follow to the letter the instructions
which I will from time to time give you.</p>

<p>In order to break the ice, I would suggest that you address
a letter to Mrs. Lucy Kline, in my care, briefly setting forth
the fact that you are a friend and client of mine, and that as
you are matrimonially inclined. I have advised you to open a
correspondence with her. You can say to her that I have favored
you with her photograph, and that same meets your approval,
and that you would very much desire her acquaintance
and what it may lead to. I have already taken up the matter
with her, and she is expecting a letter from you, and in reply
will send you her private address.</p>

<p>I would advise you, after receiving her reply, not to write
too often or too long letters. In other words, do not appear to
be too anxious, for it must devolve upon me to bring you two
together. The correspondence you may have with her is simply
a preliminary introduction leading to the establishment of congenial
relations and eventually, marriage.</p>

<p>Important business prevents my writing a longer letter to
you today, and in order that I may be prepared to take the
matter up, I suggest that you write your letter so that it will
reach my office in about one week from today.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. A. A. Burrows</span>,<br />

</p>

<p>Dear Madam:</p>

<p>I am directed by a client for whom we transact much business,
to submit you a proposition, which both he and I sincerely
hope you will accept. He is a bachelor of middle age, of
fine appearance, and is the owner of a large manufacturing
plant, as well as of a magnificent residence, in which he lived
until recently with his aged mother, who, greatly to his regret,
departed this life some six months ago. Since her death
he has felt the need of a woman's guiding hand in the management
of his household affairs, and it is to offer you a position
as his housekeeper that I am addressing you personally.</p>

<p>I beg to state that attached to the position is a salary of $75
per month, your board, and an allowance of $25 per month for
your clothing, and you will have full charge of his household
expenses, including the employment and discharge of servants,
consisting of a butler, two housemaids, driver, cook, etc.</p>

<p>If you accept the position his carriage will be at your disposal
at all times, and you will be the actual head of his household,
with no restrains of any kind upon you. As I have
stated, this client is a bachelor, and on account of his mother's
determined opposition to his marriage during her lifetime, he
has gone little in society, but since her death he has never
ceased to feel the need of a woman's hand and presence in his
home.</p>

<p>His first thought was marriage, but after a lengthy talk
with me he very cheerfully acquiesced in the suggestion that
has led to the writing of this letter, and now to the point.</p>

<p>I suggested that he allow me to secure for him a housekeeper
who might possess the qualities he most desires in a
wife, and then I consulted a matrimonial agency with that end
in view. Your description seemed to fit so exactly his idea of
true womanhood and appealed to him so strongly that his first
impulse was to address you directly, but being of a sensitive
and retiring disposition, he came to the conclusion that he
should become thoroughly acquainted with you, and could not
do better than allow me to carry out my original plan to make
your acquaintance.</p>

<p>To be candid with you, this position is a very lucrative one,
and will undoubtedly lead to your marriage with this gentleman,
if you see fit to accept the proposition, and for that reason
I trust you will give it the consideration it deserves.</p>

<p>As he secures the help necessary to the running of his large
factory through this firm, of which I happen to be the manager,
you cannot but understand that I am thoroughly acquainted
with him, and am in a position to arrange this matter to your
mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p>It is a custom to charge a fee of $5, but in this instance we
would make no charge at all, only our client, insists that we require
our usual fee simply as an evidence of good faith, and
that there may be no misunderstanding. If you accept the
proposition I have submitted kindly fill out the enclosed form
and return to us with EXPRESS MONEY ORDER or BANK
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>DRAFT for $5, which amount will be returned to you as soon
as you have taken charge of his household affairs, as your good
faith will have then been proved.</p>

<p>As soon as you can start for Chicago I will send you expense,
free railroad transportation, and if, after your arrival here,
you do not care to accept the position, a return ticket, etc.,
will be furnished you so that you will not be out one dollar of
expense.</p>

<p>This offer is made to you in the strictest confidence, and I
sincerely trust you will so regard it, and not discuss it with
any one, at least not until all the details have been arranged.</p>

<p>No matrimonial agency in the world can do this for you, nor
do I think such an opportunity will ever occur to you again,
so kindly sign the enclosed form and return it to me immediately
with the small fee necessary, or do not write me at all.
No harm will have been done by having submitted the proposition
to you, but if you cannot take immediate advantage of
it, I simply will not correspond further in the matter. Trusting
that you will see your way clear, and wishing you well, I am,</p>

<p class="author">
Very sincerely,<br />

<p>The above are illustrations of the method. Cannon, Rev.
Spencer and Attorney Edwards are all one and the same man.
We now turn to a few special examples of differences of procedure
among the various bureaux.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A Persistent Offender.</span></h4>

<p>One of the most successful operators who ever invaded Chicago
with matrimonial schemes was one John Carson, who, on
April 8, 1908, was fined $1,000 and costs for misuse of the
United States mails after he had plead guilty to the charge,
which was preferred by Inspector Ketcham.</p>

<p>Carson, at one time or another, operated no less than eighteen
concerns of this nature. He was first discovered in 1902
in Chicago by Detective Wooldridge, operating no less than
five matrimonial and fake concerns simultaneously. These
concerns were:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">The Loretta Matrimonial Publishing Co., 98 Ogden Ave.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The Unida Matrimonial Publishing Co., 408 Ogden Ave.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Mr. John's Matrimonial Publishing Co., 565 West Madison
St.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Mr. J. C. Hills Matrimonial Agency, 565 West Madison St.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The Chicago Mutual Securities Co., a Chicago Medicine
concern, 567 W. Madison St.</li>
</ul>

<p>Carson evaded arrest and fled to St. Louis, where he was
shortly afterward arrested by the postal authorities and sentenced
to eighteen months in the State Penitentiary at Jefferson
City, in addition to a fine of $500.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Bobs Up Again.</span></h4>

<p>In 1904 Carson bobbed up again in Chicago. Since that time
his record is best given from a report made to Chief of Police
John M. Collins by Detective Wooldridge, who repeatedly
broke up Carson's games. The report, in part, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Feb. 9, J. H. Carson Woods' Advertising Agency, 62 Ada
St. Goods confiscated; fined $25.</p>

<p>March 9, 1904, J. H. Carson, Mill's Advertising Agency, 71
W. Lake St. Fined $15.</p>

<p>May 4, 1904, J. H. Carson, alias J. H. Hayes, 408 Ogden
Ave., raided. Literature seized and destroyed by order of court.</p>

<p>May 4, 1904, J. H. Carson, alias J. H. Hayes, 255 Madison
St., raided. Literature seized and destroyed by order of court.</p>

<p>Nov. 15, 1904, J. H. Carson, alias J. W. Bessie, 480 Ogden
Ave., raided. Arrested; released; writ of habeas corpus.</p>

<p>Nov. 15, 1904, J. H. Carson, alias J. W. Bessie, 67 Flournoy
St., raided. Arrested; released; writ of habeas corpus.</p>

<p>Jan. 4, 1905, J. H. Carson and Oscar Wells, promoted and
run the J. H. Hunter Matrimonial Agency, 164 East Randolph
St. Oscar Wells was arrested and fined $50 by Justice John K.
Prindiville.</p>

<p>April 19, 1905, J. H. Carson and J. R. Ferguson, conducted
the Jesse H. Lee Matrimonial Agency, 84 Washington St. Ferguson
was arrested and fined $15 by Caverley. The literature
seized and destroyed.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Turns Clairvoyant.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>May 27, 1905, J. H. Carson conducted the Clay's American
Bureau of Correspondence, 62 Ada St. He was arrested and
fined $25 by Justice John K. Prindiville. The literature
seized and destroyed.</p>

<p>Aug. 21, 1905, J. H. Carson and J. R. Ferguson conduced
the Ferguson Directory, a Matrimonial agency at 171 Washington
St. This place was raided and Jesse R. Ferguson was
arrested and fined $25 by Justice John K. Prindiville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>May 27, 1905, J. H. Carson conducted the Jesse Lee Matrimonial
Agency, 84 Washington St. He was arrested and fined
$25 by Justice John K. Prindiville.</p>

<p>Aug. 19, 1905, J. H. Carson was arrested for conducting a
Chicago Matrimonial Agency at 171 Washington St. and 95
Fifth Ave., under the name of Prof. John C. Hall, Astrologist,
Occult, Scientist, Clairvoyant, Medium, and Lifereader.</p>
</div>

<p>With this record behind him this rascal actually had the nerve
to bring suit for false arrest against Detective Wooldridge, but
quite naturally, he failed to appear when the suit came up for
trial.</p>

<p>He has not been heard from since the fine imposed on April
8, 1908, by the Federal authorities.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Agents of the Underworld a Nest of Pole-Cats.</span></h4>

<p>But crime is not the only long suit of the Matrimonial
Agency. Some of these miserable frauds have descended into
the depths and wallowed in the slime of the ultimate shame.</p>

<p>With unbelievable effrontery they have attempted to trade
upon the basest instincts in human nature; they have attempted
to coin the most abominable of the brute passions of men.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the turpitude, the brazen shamelessness
of the Matrimonial Agency, when it decides to go the limit.</p>

<p>Attest the following from the literature of the New Era Advertising
Agency and Introduction Bureau, Curtis, Clark &amp;
Co., Props., formerly located at 112 Clark street, Chicago.
This abomination was raided by Detective Wooldridge and the
following sample from one of the circulars seized shows the
nature of the concern:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If you are willing to give your name and protection to one
who has fallen and wishes again to enter the ranks of respectability,
we have some young women who have led fast lives
and accumulated considerable money, and want to marry some
respectable man, settle down in a new place and be respected
and respectable. THEY ARE HANDSOME, STYLISH,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
LIVELY AND FULL OF FUN: HAVE MONEY ENOUGH
FOR BOTH. They will no doubt make good, loving and true
wives for some good-natured fellow who is not particular about
their past. Through our efforts several wealthy ladies of the
demi-monde have married very poor men in return for their
name and protection, given them a life of ease and luxury, and
the opportunities are greater today than in the past, considering
the fact that the world in general is anxious to lend a
helping hand to those who have erred and wish to become respectable
again."</p>
</div>

<p>This pole-cat literature was being sent broadcast through
the United States mails. In some way it evaded the inspectors
until the 23rd of September, 1902, when Detective Clifton R.
Wooldridge descended upon the nest of pole-cats, seized the literature,
chased "Curtis, Clark &amp; Co." out of Chicago, and
made further evil-smelling operations impossible.</p>

<p>These abominations are now practically impossible, thanks
to the activity of the great police detective. But the above
illustrations shows to what depths the marriage bureaus can
descend, once they have become started on their infamous
careers.</p>

<p>November 26, 1902, Detective Wooldridge raided the Climax
Matrimonial Agency, located at 418 LaSalle avenue, which is
situated on the North Side, in one of the most fashionable
places in Chicago.</p>

<p>It was run not only as a matrimonial agency, but a matrimonial
paper and mail order house. Among the literature
seized was a circular containing a picture of the manager's wife,
and of which he sent out over 300,000. which gave the description
of her, which read as follows:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sheriff Duped&mdash;Attempts Role of Lothario.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am 23 years of age, 5 feet 2 inches in height, weigh 120
pounds, have a turn-up nose, plain-looking and worth about
$147,000. I desire to marry a good, honest, affectionate man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
On our wedding day I will give my husband $5,500 in cash,
and one year later, if we are still living together, I will make
over to him $25,000 more. No milk-and-water man need answer."</p></div>

<p>One letter from a Mississippi sheriff shows that the officer of

though plain, advertises that on her wedding day she will give
her husband $5,500. This is the gay Lothario's letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Miss Ot&mdash;I take pleasure in answering your "ad" in the
"Hour at Home." You stated in your "ad" you were worth
$147,000, and would give the man that married you $5,500 on
his wedding day. You say you are plain.</p>

<p>I am good looking, so the people tell me, and if you correspond
with me we may come to an understanding. I am willing
to marry you if you give me proof you have the money, and
will do all that you say in the "ad."</p>

<p>I will do my best to make your life happy. Awaiting your
reply, I remain.</p></div>

<h3>BIGAMY AND THE BUREAU.</h3>

<h4>Where the Professional Bigamists Find Wives.</h4>

<p>The matrimonial agencies that have been investigated and
suppressed by Detective Wooldridge and the postoffice authorities
have disclosed an almost incredible phase of woman's
nature.</p>

<p>There are today in the United States no less than 50,000
women who have been married, robbed and deserted by "professional
bigamists." This fact represent the most serious
phase of the matrimonial agency swindle, for it is the history
of nearly all noted bigamists that they secured their victims
through the matrimonial agencies. Of the thousands who become
subscribers to these agencies, however, comparatively
few ever proceed far enough to encounter the tragic features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of the swindle. It might be inferred from this that women
are much easier to entice into matrimony than men. Probably,
however, this is an untenable conclusion. When a
woman does start on marrying bent, mere men fall before her
like grain before the sickle. Miss Marion Rapp, arrested at
Philadelphia, is known to have secured eight husbands in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
years, and is suspected of having captured six or eight more.
Miss Rapp is still young, and if her career had not been untimely
cut off she might have made a record that would have
done credit (or discredit) to her sex.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 498px;">
<img src="images/img039.jpg" width="498" height="580" alt="PUTS A SNAFFLE BIT ON THE OLD MAN" />
<div class="caption">PUTS A SNAFFLE BIT ON THE OLD MAN</div>
</div>

<p>The sad experiences of people who have been victimized by
gay deceivers, male or female, perhaps contain a lesson to persons
who carelessly contemplate matrimony. When a stranger
proposes marriage at first sight it may possibly be well to take
a look into his or her antecedents. This is not the most romantic
way to proceed, but it is a way that may have a great
practical advantage. It probably would be endorsed by every
one of the 50,000 women in this country who are now looking
for professional bigamists who married them and ran away
with their cash.</p>

<p>That the matrimonial agency business is not confined to
Chicago and dupes of the system are found elsewhere than in
rural communities and among the poor and humble is demonstrated
by recent revelations in Europe. During one raid I
seized a large quantity of literature in the offices of a swindling
concern doing business under the name of Mason, Brown &amp; Co.
The "firm" advertised itself as the largest of its kind in the
world and the only one "indorsed by press and public and
patronized by royalty," adding that its "clients and representatives
were to be found in every land."</p>

<p>In extra large type the information was conveyed to the
victim that he or she need not be ashamed to resort to the
agency method in order to secure a life partner, as the royalty
of Europe used this means exclusively in contracting marriages,
especially in cases where American heiresses were sought as
wives for titled but impecunious foreigners.</p>

<p>When it was casually remarked during an examination of a
wagon load of Mason, Brown &amp; Company's advertising matter
the reference to the titles and heiresses was the only true statement
it contained, there were smiles of incredulity. American
millionaires were said to be too shrewd and level-headed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
enter into deals with marriage brokers when the life happiness
of their fair and independent daughters is concerned.</p>

<img src="images/img040.jpg" width="430" height="550" alt="(Divorce Decrees; Spring)" />
<div class="caption">(Divorce Decrees; Spring)</div>
</div>

<p>It was but a short time after this conversation, however, that
the following cablegram was published:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Case of Count Larisch.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Aug. 25th, 1905: The alleged attempt to blackmail Count
Franz Joseph Maria Von Larisch Monnich out of 200,000 marks
on a pre-nuptial note alleged to have been signed by the count,
and the implication of army officers and members of the aristocracy
in the marriage brokerage business, has caused more talk in
high circles than anything which has happened since the elopement
of Crown Princess Louise of Saxony."</p></div>

<p>It is said the Kaiser had to take a hand in the matter, and
insists that this business shall be stopped finally and effectively
on the ground it is bringing the army and nobility into disrepute
and ridicule.</p>

<p>The harm done by these agencies is almost incalculable.
Foolish women having money at their disposal fall easy victims
to the many scheming scoundrels who make a practice
of subscribing to the matrimonial agencies for the purpose of
securing the addresses of prospective victims.</p>

<p>As instances of the harm done by these matrimonial agencies
the case of Johann Hoch, who married fifty women, and
after securing all their money, either poisoned or deserted
them. He was captured in New York City, January 30, 1905,
after he had married a woman in Chicago, Mary Schultz, alias
Brees, alias Bauman, poisoned her, then made love to her sister,
married her, secured what money she had and deserted her.
Hoch was brought back to Chicago, tried for murder, convicted
and hung February 23 1906. This is a glaring example.</p>

</div>

<p>The case of Fredrick Carlton, indicted on two charges of
grand larceny in Brooklyn, New York, July, 1905, is another.</p>

<p>It is stated on what seems to be reliable authority this man
made the acquaintance of women in various parts of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
through the medium of matrimonial advertisements, married
them and decamped with their money at the first favorable
opportunity. Still another:</p>

<p>Dr. George A. Witzhoff, champion bigamist, arrested in
Bristol, England, October, 1905, for bigamy and given a long
term in prison. He was wanted in many cities in the United
States.</p>

<p>Witzhoff confessed to marrying and robbing thirty-two
women. Most all of the women he married lived in the United
States, and were secured through the matrimonial agencies.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Witzhoff's Confession&mdash;Bought Fifteen Wives From One
Agent&mdash;Takes $4,000 From His First Wife.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Then, one night, after indulging in plenty of wine, she
confessed she had a child in Pittsburg. I left her there, telling
her I was going to bring her child, which was nine years
old. Instead, I went to New York with her money ($4,000),
and paid my friend part of his money, and started a practice
as a dentist in Fourteenth street as Dr. A. R. Houser. I went
to see a matchmaker. He introduced me to a widow of means.
We got married in two weeks at the City Hall, New York.</p>

<p>"She had all her money loaned away, so I was compelled to
seek another one, as Sig. Badillo was hard after his balance of
$1,000."</p>

<p>"I went, to Philadelphia and got a Jewish matchmaker again
on Fifteenth street and Fairmount avenue, and he introduced
me to a Miss Jocker as Dr. A. Houser."</p>

<p>"I got $800 from her. I paid Badillo $500 and left for
Springfield, Mass., where a woman answered one of my ads.
I inserted an 'ad.' as follows:"</p>

<p>"'A professional gentleman of nice appearance, aged thirty-two,
desires the acquaintance of a sincere, affectionate lady,
with some means; object, matrimony; triflers ignored. Give
particulars in first letter. Address Busy Bee, the Journal.'</p>

<img src="images/img043.jpg" width="426" height="600" alt="(Man with many wives inside heart)" />

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I had about twelve answers to this advertisement, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
picked out a boarding house mistress, and ten days after she
was Mrs. Westfield, and as she was a vulgar woman, I left her
two days after. She had given me $500 before marriage.</p>

<p>"I returned to New York to wife No. 2, and a week after I
went to St. Louis and inserted an 'ad.' as previously, and got
fifteen answers. There I selected a farmer's daughter and married
her as Dr. Doesser. I married and left her all within a
week.</p>

<p>"I came to Detroit, and with her money, $350, I started a
dental practice as A. Houser. In answer to my advertisements
in a German paper, Mrs. Piser came.</p>

<p>"We went to Toledo, O., five days after our first interview,
and we got married. I left her six days after.</p>

<p>"I came now to Pittsburg, as Dr. Wolfe, got a furnished room
in Allegheny. In answer to an 'ad.' in a German paper a

<p>"There I slept the first night, and the next morning I was
on my way to Cleveland, and started a nice practice with the
$150 I had left. I paid the balance to my friend, Badillo,
and inserted an 'ad.' in the Plain-Dealer.</p>

<p>"I had two answers to my 'ad.,' and selected a Mrs. Moore,
a nurse, and a Mrs. Kreidman. I got from the nurse $100, and
was making love to Mrs. Kreidman and Mrs. Moore, when I got
a letter from wife No. 3, with whom I corresponded all the
time, telling her I traveled for a firm.</p>

<p>"So I left, and forgot that I left in Cleveland a paper under
the tablecloth which had my address in Brooklyn. One morning
(ten days after I left Cleveland) two detectives came to
the house in Brooklyn and arrested me. As there was no bail
for my offense (obtaining money under false pretenses), I returned
to Cleveland a week later, and there I married a bad
woman in jail, Mrs. Kreidman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"She gave $200 bond, but I left her four days after, as she
was a bad woman. I slept one night at her house, and three
days after I went to Chicago and went to see a matrimonial
agent at 55 Washington street.</p>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Identified in Chicago; Wedding Stopped.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He introduced me to a nice Jewess, and her father gave me
$400. I started an office on Fourteenth street, when a man
from Philadelphia recognized me, and told her father, a rag
dealer, that I was a married man, named Hausen, just in time
to prevent the marriage.</p>

<p>"I left Chicago as Dr. Weston and went to St. Louis, where
I started an office in Olive street as Dr. A. Dresser, and there
I advertised and selected from a number of letters that of a
farmer's daughter that had $1,000, and married her (Katie).
Six days after I left her and left America and went to Roumania,
and married a girl, a Jewess, in Pitest, and lived in
Roumania as Dr. F. A. Shotz.</p>

<p>"Happy six months; I got 3,000 francs, and we left for Germany.
There we had a quarrel, and she returned to her parents."</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Witzhoff further states that the number of all the girls
and women he merely promised to marry and secured money
from would reach over one hundred.</p>

<p>One of the women Witzhoff married lived in Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>May 13, 1903, John J. Marietta (alias Homer C. Reid, Harold
C. Mills, A. S. Anderson, C. H. Huston, C. B. McCoy, H.
C. Jones, Harold C. Reed) was arrested through exposure by
Laura E. Strickler, a beautiful young girl from Cincinnati,
Ohio, who boarded at the Young Women's Association, Chicago.
She had been lured to the Newport Hotel, 73 Monroe
street, where he proposed marriage and attempted liberties.
Miss Strickler became frightened, jumped from the second story
window and was badly injured.</p>

<p>Marietta married no less than six women, three of whom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Sophia Headley, Marie Butler and Flora Beals, appeared in
court to prosecute him September 28. He was convicted.

Joliet penitentiary.</p>

<p>Marietta said he secured most of his wives through the
marriage agency. Mills said to Miss Headley, after meeting
her the second time: "How anxious are you to marry me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Make me an offer in cash of the sum you are willing to settle
on me." "Three thousand dollars," she answered. "All right,"
he replied, "but you know I am from Missouri, you will have
to show me." She gave him the $3,000 and they were married.</p>

<p>At the time of his conviction Marietta had in the bank
$25,000, said to have been secured in the above manner.</p>

<h3>BREAKING INTO THE NOBILITY.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">How Titled Rakes Use the Agencies.</span></h4>

<p>The marriage bureau is not a distinctly American institution.
They know the animal in Europe, only there the operators
refer to themselves as marriage brokers, and are decidedly
more careful than their American prototypes to steer clear
of crime.</p>

<p>The idea of marriage broking has thoroughly permeated the
effete nobility of Europe. The broken-down "nobles," out at
heels and buried under a mountain of debt, look to America
for a rich heiress to whom their titles may be sold. For many
years they looked to the brokers on their own side of the water
to provide them with golden girls; but of late years they have
been mixing with the American Matrimonial Agencies, sometimes
to their sorrow, as attest the case of Count Larisch.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Woes of Count Larisch.</span></h4>

<p>The story of the attempt on Count Larisch is not an unusual
one. Briefly, the count, who is an Austrian, but who has estates
in Prussia, was anxious to replenish his treasury by marrying
an heiress. A syndicate composed of the men now under
indictment, it is said, financed him. He set out to marry the
daughter of Faber, the multi-millionaire pencil manufacturer
of Nuremberg, giving his notes for $50,000, payable upon his
marriage to Fraulein Faber. The venture was a failure, for
Fraulein Faber did not care to become Countess Larisch. The
noble fortune-hunter then went to America in quest of a bride.
Whether it was on his own account, or under the auspices of
another marriage syndicate, does not appear, though it is hinted
the latter is the case. In any event, he was successful, and
married Miss Satterlee, of Titusville, Pa.</p>

<p>On his return the members of the first Faber syndicate demanded
payment, and presented a note purporting to have been
given by Larisch without the qualification that it was payable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
only after his marriage to the pencil manufacturer's daughter.
Larisch, regarding the Faber affair a closed incident, and declaring
the note presented a forgery, refused to pay. The
matter got before the public prosecutor and the exposé resulted.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lord Bertie Cavendish&mdash;Champion Matrimonialist.</span></h4>

<p>Oct. 24, 1905, Miss Gladys Simmons, Hot Springs, Ark.,
married Lord Bertie Cavendish after two days' acquaintance.
He represented himself to be of noble birth, son of the late
Marquis of Queensbury, and to have immense possessions in
South Africa and Mexico, which he was unable to obtain on
account of his banishment from England for serving against
the British in the Boer war, due to the activity of British army
officers against him.</p>

<p>Miss Simmons' mother received information that her son-in-law's
name was not Lord Bertie Cavendish, but Douglass. By
photographs and further investigation his identity was established
as that of an adventurer.</p>

<p>Following is a partial list of his wives, several of whom
have asked the court to grant them divorces:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">Miss Louisiana Hobbs, Lambert Point, Va., near Norfolk.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Mrs. Mabel Duncan, Denver, Colo.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Mrs. Scott, South Bend, Ind.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Mrs. Beatrice E. Anderson, Fort Worth, Texas.</li>
</ul>


<h4><span class="smcap">Market for American Heiresses.</span></h4>

<p>There has been more than one similar scandal involving
members of the high nobility and rich American girls.</p>

<p>It will be remembered last year there was a stir created by
The broadcast announcement that Prince Hugo Von Hohenche-Oehringen,
Prince Heinrich Von Hanan and Baron Berhard-Muenhausen,
accused an Englishman, O'Brien, who was alleged
to be the agent of Berlin marriage brokers, of attempted
blackmail.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mrs. Jennie Scott, Arrested by Postal Inspectors, Tells
Secrets of Her Matrimonial Agency.</span></h4>

<p>The second blow has been struck against the affinity trust,
of Chicago, and the second member of the alleged trust in
Chicago, Mrs. Jennie Scott, a woman of many aliases, by
Postoffice Inspector James E. Stuart.</p>

<p>This woman was arrested at her home, at 214 Thirty-second
street, her "Cupid shop," where she received thousands of letters,
descriptions and photographs of affinity seekers from all
over the United States and Canada. She received them in the
name of "Glinn's International Corresponding Association," to
join which from $2 to $5 was drawn from each affinity. Thousands
joined.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Same Literature Used as in Marion Grey Case.</span></h4>

<p>Postoffice Inspectors A. E. Germer and Frank Sheron worked
up the case against the woman and discovered that the same
literature was used by this woman as was used by Marion
Grey, convicted for the misuse of the mails in operating an
affinity matching business at Elgin.</p>

<p>There were some changes, however, in the method. This is
shown in the literature sent out by this woman. Her literature
explains to the affinities that the business is absolutely honest
and above board, and must be kept so. Under "special reduced
rates," she drew in hundreds of women clients, many
of whom sent in their pictures.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott operated also at 2208 Wabash avenue, where she
had a room for receiving mail. She was known not only as
Mrs. Scott, but as E. L. Glinn, Mrs. Jennie Call, Mrs. A. M.
Harvey and Mrs. E. L. Glinn. She lived on Thirty-second
street, with her young daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Clients All Wealthy; Take Their Word for It.</span></h4>

<p>Almost every client on the books of this marriage-fostering
concern claimed to be worth from $5,000 to £1,000,000 sterling.</p>

<p>Many of them were alleged to have large incomes. Some
were said to have children and are not to be divorced, but still
seek life partners.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Witnesses Need a Shepherd.</span></h4>

<p>Then, from among the queer little party huddled together
on the benches at the rear of the big court room&mdash;a helpless,
shepherdless flock&mdash;Mr. Shirer began to call out his witnesses.</p>

<p>First of the hungering souls who sought life companions
through Mrs. Scott came Mrs. Mary Quinn, of Trenton, Ill., a
short, dumpy little person of about thirty-five or forty, who
was chiefly remarkable for the white hat she wore.</p>

<p>"I saw the ad.," she whispered&mdash;it was with the greatest
difficulty that Judge Bethea induced her to talk so she could
be heard ten feet away&mdash;"and I answered it. They sent me back
a circular and a photograph of a nice-looking fellow who was
said to be rich.</p>

<p>"I sent my $2 and wrote that I would like to get into correspondence
with him. They sent me back word that he was
corresponding with another lady just then, and didn't want
any more names at present, but there was another one just as
good.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Nice Letters Lack Rich Tone.</span></h4>

<p>"I corresponded with him until three weeks before I remarried
my divorced husband, last December. He wrote very nice
letters, but he certainly didn't sound rich."</p>

<p>"You got what you asked for, didn't you?" asked Mr. Murphy.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I guess so; I'm not complaining."</p>

<p>The uncomplainingness of the alleged victims is the odd
feature of the case.</p>

<p>Dr. Montgomery Porter, a graduate of the University of
Arkansas, came all the way from his home in Pine Bluff, to
say that he had answered one of Mrs. Scott's advertisements
but had not paid the $5 fee, "which she charged the men members."</p>

<p>Porter C. Dyer, a graduate of the Ohio State University, who
lives in Austin, O., said that he paid the fee and was disappointed,
"because the names sent were not those of refinement
and culture, as promised in the circulars."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flora Scott, a restaurant keeper at Middleport, O., tall
and not particularly stylish, couldn't recall what any of the
circulars said, but she was quite sure she hadn't landed a rich
husband yet.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Southern Beauty Sends $2.</span></h4>

<p>The handsomest of the witnesses was Miss Avis Christenberry,
a stately brunette from Memphis, who rather liked the
looks of the rich young man's photograph used for bait and sent
in $2.</p>

<p>"They told me he was corresponding with some one else
just then," she testified, "and I corresponded with two substitutes,
but they didn't entertain me much."</p>

<p>Wilson Schufelt, a real estate man, said that he had rented
the matrimonial headquarters to "Mrs. A. M. Harvey" for a
mail order house business. Mrs. Harvey got her mail under
the names of Glinn and Hill, and when the postal authorities
became interested in her she told Schufelt that her name was
Jennie Scott. At her home, 214 East Thirty-second street, she
is known as Mrs. Jennie Call.</p>

<p>She was indicted under the name of Glinn. It was testified
by E. J. Beach, superintendent of the Twenty-second street
sub-postal station, that the matrimonial agency received from
50 to 200 letters every day.</p>

<p>She was arraigned before Judge Bethea and found guilty,
on April 25, 1908, and was sentenced to one year in the House
of Correction, and was fined $500.</p>

<h3>THE HORRIBLE GUNNESS FARM.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Ripened Fruit of the Matrimonial Agency.</span></h4>

<p>But the giant blossom of this plant of hell is not bigamy, not
swindling, not desertion; it is murder, wholesale, ghastly murder.
For it is the matrimonial agency, nothing else, which is
directly responsible for the unbelievable horrors of the Gunness
Murder Farm, at Laporte, Ind., the revelation of the existence
of which shocked the entire civilized world as it has not
been shocked since the time of the Borgias.</p>

<p>This wholesale murderess invariably lured her victims to
their fate through advertisements in a "matrimonial paper," or
through an agency. She would insert the usual stereotyped
"ad." of the wealthy widow lady who desired a mate, but always
a mate with money.</p>

<p>Always being able to produce proof that she was well-to-do,
it was an easy matter for her to persuade her victims to visit
her at the Laporte farm. She invariably stipulated that they
should bring a substantial sum with them.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Gunness farm, the prospective suitors were
invariably impressed with the evidences of wealth and luxury.
After a stay of a few days, during which time the cunning
murderess would find out how much money her victim had, and
whether he could immediately procure more in the form of
cash, the victim would be invited to supper and his food
drugged.</p>

<p>He would then be escorted to his room, where he would soon
become unconscious. Chloroform was then administered, the
body hurled through a chute to the basement, where it would
be dismembered and placed in a gunnysack.</p>

<p>The sack would then be taken out and buried in a convenient
spot on the farm. It was an inquiry from the brother
of one of the victims, Andrew Helgelein, which revealed the
whole horrible affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>It is estimated that this woman, through the aid of the matrimonial
agencies, murdered more people than any other human
being that ever lived. She exceeded the records of the Benders,
Holmes, and even those arch-assassins of the middle ages,
the Borgias.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Lombroso Discusses Monster.</span></h4>

<p>Dr. Cesare Lombroso, of the University of Milan, the world's
greatest criminologist, in discussing this woman, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In general the moral physiognomy of the born female criminal
approximates strongly to that of the male. The female
criminal is exceedingly weak in maternal feeling, inclined to
dissipation, astute and audacious, and dominates weaker beings
sometimes by suggestion, and at other times by muscular force;
while her love of violent exercise, her vices and even her dress,
increase her resemblance to the stronger sex.</p>

<p>"Added to these virile characteristics are often the worst
qualities of women; namely, an excessive desire for revenge,
cunning cruelty, love of dress and untruthfulness, forming a
combination of evil tendencies which often results in a type
of extraordinary wickedness. Needless to say these different
characteristics are not found in the same proportion in everybody.
One criminal will be deficient in intelligence, but possessed
of great strength, while another, who is weak physically,
triumphs over this obstacle by the ability with which she lays
her plans.</p>

<p>"But when, by an unfortunate chance, muscular strength
and intellectual force meet in the same individual, we have a
female delinquent of a terrible type, indeed.</p>

<p>"In short, we may assume that if female-born criminals are
fewer in number than the males; they are usually much more
ferocious.</p>

<p>"What is the explanation? We observe that the normal
woman is naturally less sensitive to pain than a man, and
compassion is the offspring of sensitiveness. If the one be
wanting, so will the other be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"We also find that women have many traits in common with
children; that their moral sense is deficient; that they are revengeful,
jealous, inclined to vengeances of a refined cruelty.</p>

<p>"In ordinary cases these defects are neutralized by piety,
maternity, want of passion, by weakness and an undeveloped
intelligence. But when a morbid activity of the psychical
centres intensifies the bad qualities of women, and induces them
to seek relief in evil deeds; when piety and maternal sentiments
are wanting, and in their place are strong passions, much muscular
strength and a superior intelligence for the conception
and execution of evil, it is clear that the innocuous semi-criminal
present in the normal woman must be transformed into the
born criminal more terrible than any man.</p>

<p>"What terrific criminals would children be if they had strong
passions, muscular strength and sufficient intelligence; and if,
moreover, their evil tendencies were exasperated by a morbid
intellectual activity! And women are big children; their evil
tendencies are much more numerous and more varied than
men's, but generally remain latent. When they are awakened
and excited they produce results proportionately greater."</p>

<h3>IN LIGHTER VEIN.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>The Funny Side of the Matrimonial Business.</b></p>

<p>There is necessarily the amusing side in all this miserable
trading upon the affections of fools. Some of the letters sent
in to the matrimonial agencies are little less than "screams."</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, a big, husky farmer, a collarless, coatless
son of the Utah deserts, gushing forth that he "could live and
die on love." Think of a staid and sober trained nurse who
has arrived at the ripe age of forty pouring into the ears of
the matrimonial agent that she "wants a man who is a flower,"
and also saying confidingly that she believes that she requires
a few more years in which to prepare for the "solemn step."</p>

<p>One who is 39 and dark, blushingly admits that she is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
"young girl" of loving disposition, and, since love is the destiny
of us all, prays for a husband of fifty or thereabouts.</p>

<p>One who describes herself as "lively and frolicsome" frankly
admits that she is out for the money and can get along without
the love end of it at all. It is needless to say that this letter
comes from the Pennsylvania Dutch regions.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the gems:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Could Live and Die on Love.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="author">
Huntsville. Utah,<br />
Dec. 27. 1902.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ellen Marion.</span><br />
<span class="i2">Grant Works, Ill.</span>
</p>

<p>My Dear Lady:</p>

<p>I wish to beg your pardon if I appear rude in trying to
personally introduce myself, but allow me to assure you that
I am sincere in my quest for a kind friend, and it is nothing
but the purest and holiest motives of the human heart that
prompts the intrusion.</p>

<p>I saw your advertisement in the Valley Farmer, and in it
I seem to behold the image of an ideal lady, who is well
worthy of the highest esteem and admiration from a true
gentleman, and how happy and thankful should the man be
who is so fortunate as to captivate the love and heart of so
noble a prize. Among many others your advertisement to me
seemed to be the most suitable and impressive. While it would
not be within good taste to express a great love for you at
present, yet I believe that I could come as near living and
dying on love as the next one. My object in writing you is
to find if there should be a chord within our natures that could
be touched mutually to harmonize with the word love.</p>

<p>I have been married and know of the joy and happiness of
a kind and loving companion. Two years ago death robbed
me of my greatest prize in life. Since then I have been baching
it. I am tired of roughing it alone, and if there were only
some one to meet me with a kind smile of approval I could work
much harder and be a better man for it, and I do most earnestly
and sincerely solicit your correspondence with a view to closer
ties should our natures prove congenial.</p>

<p>Should you feel inclined to favor me I would certainly feel
highly flattered.</p>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Not a Flirt.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Please do not rank me with the ordinary flirts and adventurers,
for I assure you that I am honest in my intentions and
would not mislead or advise anyone wrongfully. My age is
thirty-seven, height five feet nine inches, weight 175 pounds,
have a good moral character in every respect, honest and industrious,
without any bad habits, total abstainer from liquor and
tobacco, move in the best society, am of a quiet, kind and
loving disposition. Home is the dearest place to me on earth
and I know how to make it happy. I can appreciate and know
the real value of a kind and loving wife, and the dear lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
that becomes my wife will find in me a true and honest husband,
a kind and loving companion, one whose greatest aim
and object will be to make his home and loved ones happy.</p>

<p>To you the above may have a smattering of self-praise and
flattery, but the facts are wholly true, which I hope in due
time will be fully demonstrated. Should you wish to hear
further from me I shall be quite pleased to furnish any information
desired.</p>

<p>Anxiously awaiting your acquaintance, I am,</p>

<p class="author">
Yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">Jens Winter</span>.
</p>

<p>With best wishes and compliments of the season.</p>

<h4>LOVELORN WAILS.</h4>

<p>I want a man who is a flower, with love and affection oozing
from all its petals. Maybe, however, I need a few more years'
preparation for the most solemn of steps&mdash;matrimony. I admire
a man of good physique, kind, gallant, conscientious, of
good morals as can be expected nowadays, home-loving, and
fond of children.&mdash;Application for a husband from Catherine
M. Barnes, trained nurse, aged 40, Indianapolis.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Love is the destiny of us all. At times it seems it is going
to side-track and pass us. Therefore, I ask you to help me
to find a handsome man of 50 or over who has some money
and can make more.</p>

<p>I am a young girl of loving disposition; do not powder, except
on special occasions; can cook, and know how to dress
on nothing or little. I want love and fidelity. Do not send me
the name of any traveling men.</p>

<p>I am 39 and dark.&mdash;Miss Ella Miller, 837 Spring Garden
street, Philadelphia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Introduce me to a widow with money who wants a good
entertainer and honest man. I have no funds, but don't tell
her that. I play, sing and recite well.&mdash;Adam Werker, Glen
Ellyn, Ill.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Her Ideal Husband.</span></h4>

<p>"My ideal must be tall," suggests Miss Mary Hester, from
Wayland, N. Y., "and a gentleman in every sense of the word.
He must be of good standing socially and morally. He must
be of temperate habits, kind, generous, affectionate, devoted&mdash;a
man of ability, who would be a companion socially, intellectually
and morally to a true, pure, devoted wife."</p>

<p>She says she would ask for no more.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">This One Is Real Frank.</span></h4>

<p>Here is another letter from Reading, Pa:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Sir: I notice by Sunday's paper that you are looking
for a wife. Now, strange to relate, I am looking for a husband.
I don't know what your requirements are, but I do know
mine, and the chief ones of them are money, a good home,
less work and worry, and happiness. If love comes, too, I
shall not object, although I have lived long enough to realize
that there can be a sort of lukewarm happiness without love.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I judge my capacity is sufficiently large
to satisfy the sort of a man I judge you to be. Now, for the
next item of importance&mdash;myself. I am tall and slender, five
feet six inches high, and quite "figuresque," as one of my girl
friends tells me. I am of the Irish-American type; hair
medium in shade and profuse as to quantity; deep-set, very
bright gray eyes; good carriage, on account of which strangers
often consider me haughty&mdash;an entirely erroneous idea.</p>

<p>Am of a lively, frolicsome nature. I am full of fun, and no
matter how black things are I always find something to laugh
at. I am twenty-three years old, and decidedly domestic, that
being, in fact, my only accomplishment. I am artistic only
along some lines; have no musical talent and am not an artist,
but I love both devotedly. Am very practical, in fact, and a
good housekeeper. There is lots more I might tell you, but
we will call this enough for the present. Should like to know
something about you, and hope you will be as truthful and
frank as I have been.</p>

<p class="author">
Sincerely yours,<br />

<h3>ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>A Matrimonial Agent Captures a Rich Husband and Retires
from Business.</b></p>

<p>Mamie Marie Schultz, a matrimonial agent, outwits the
police and postal authorities after being raided and broken up,
moves to other quarters, continues business, finds a rich man
seeking a wife among her patrons and marries him.</p>

<p>September 11, the German-American Agency, run by Mamie
Marie Schultz, 3150 Calumet avenue, was raided by Detective
Wooldridge, the literature seized and destroyed. Mamie Marie
Schultz was fined $25 by Justice Hurley. The evidence obtained
was submitted to the postal authorities for action.</p>

<p>Mamie Marie Schultz fled to Oak Park, where she continued
her matrimonial agency. After she moved to Oak Park she
was notified "by order of the town board" to vacate, but she
laughed at the order and enjoyed the newspaper notoriety she
attained, for it only increased her business. It is said she
made thousands of dollars out of her matrimonial agency.</p>

<p>With a stealth that is characteristic of his art, Cupid has
accomplished what Oak Park officials had been trying to do
for two years. He has closed out the Oak Park matrimonial
agency by making a victim of his promoter in that vicinity,
Marie Schultz, manager of the matchmakers' concern.</p>

<p>The postmaster, United States marshal and several of the
town officers yesterday received letters signed "Mrs. J. D. Edwards,"
announcing that Marie Schultz "had been caught in
her own net" and had deserted the village for a "palatial" home
in Seattle, Wash., where her new husband, J. D. Edwards, is
a wealthy lumber dealer.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Swift Courtship by Edwards.</span></h4>

<p>Edwards, it is said, arrived in Oak Park on Tuesday, and
after a whirlwind courtship this "Lochinvar who came out of
the West" had won the whole matrimonial agency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Marie," the name in which all her extensive advertising
was done, has defeated the officials of Chicago, Oak Park, and
even the United States postoffice inspector, in every effort they
made to suppress her enterprise.</p>

<p>To Postmaster Hutchinson she wrote requesting that all
letters addressed to the agency be returned to the writers, as
she didn't "want any more of their money." The postoffice
force was burdened with the task of mailing back to some 500
lovelorn men and maidens the letters which had accumulated
in "Marie's" postoffice box.</p>

<p>But the bleatings of the overgrown calf from Utah, and the
wails of the maiden lady who desires a "flower" for a mate are
both eclipsed by the mushy outpourings of a Chicago business
man.</p>

<p>This fellow evidently possesses the artistic temperament.
Not only is he moved to write prose poetry, "to bay the moon
of love," but he insists on inserting illustrative sketches of an
ardent wooing.</p>

<p>He has forged the white heat of his passion, which evidently
puts Ella Wheeler Wilcox at her fiercest to shame, into pictures.
Here we behold him, hand in hand with his beloved,
under the kindly stars. There, more prosaic, it is true, but
still quite passionate, is the drawing room scene, with the lady
seated on his knee. Behold the works of genius when love
impels.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Festive Farm Hand Frivols.</span></h4>

<p>Among the hundreds of applications for a wife Detective
Wooldridge found one from Jacob C. Miller, of Martinsville.

</ul>



<h3>THE FAKER AND THE PRESS.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Some Newspapers Are Buncoed, While Others Willingly
Assist Rascals.</span></h4>

<p>Strangely enough, the abomination known as the "matrimonial
agency," bureau or what-not, has succeeded in hoodwinking
the great American press to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Advertisements appear in leading journals all over the
country. Without this the great fraud could not exist ten
minutes. There are numberless instances, we are quite sure,
where the publishers have no suspicion that they are furthering
the cause of scoundrels. In others, we regret to say, the
motive for accepting these advertisements is traceable to nothing
more or less than just the plain greed of the publisher.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a private citizen to prophesy whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the entire power of the government of the United States can
purify the columns of some of our greedy newspapers.</p>

<div class="caption">HOW TO TRAIN A HUSBAND</div>
</div>

<p>These matrimonial agencies are frauds. The newspaper man
knows this and takes their money for the advertisements, and
becomes a messenger of a crime for a paltry sum, and if I
were the District Attorney I would get busy and call the
attention of the Postmaster General to these alleged newspapers
for the purpose of shutting off their distribution through
the mails.</p>

<p>Here are a few samples of the ads appearing in the reputable
daily press of the country:</p>

<p>And all this, ridiculous, murderous and otherwise, is all outside
the pale of the law. The matrimonial agency is a crime
<em class="italic">per se</em>. It is a criminal institution. It has been pronounced
to be such by the best and foremost judges of the United States,
Germany and Great Britain.</p>

<p>Judge Klerbach, sitting in the case of a marriage broker at
Goettingen, Germany, in 1903, declared that the marriage
broker was a criminal in intent, from the very nature of his
business.</p>

<p>In the celebrated case of Alan Murray vs. Jeanie McDonald
at Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1898, Justice Grahame pronounced
from the judicial seat one of the most scathing arraignments
of the marriage bureau ever delivered. "Leeches upon the
body social, blood-suckers, destroyers of womanhood, abominations
of the bottomless pit," were some of the phrases used by
Justice Grahame in denouncing Murray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>In the petty sessions at Tinahely, Ireland, Justice O'Gorman
in May, 1905, is reported in the Wicklow People, a newspaper
which has a wide circulation in the South of Ireland, as fiercely
denouncing the marriage broker business. The Justice declared
that the marriage broker was a wolf, "preying upon
the weaknesses of humanity, a pander to the lowest instincts";
that he had no right to demand the interference of the law in
his behalf, but rather that the law should always be exercised
for the suppression of his nefarious traffic.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Same Thing Nearer Home.</span></h4>

<p>To get nearer home. In the Chicago American, February 12,
1903, Judge Neely, in the case of the State vs. Hattie Howard,
declared from the bench that to "sell men and women in marriage
is the height of crime." Judge Neely further said:</p>

<p>"Men and women who engage in this business of promoting
matrimony for money are guilty of crime. It is opposed to
the fundamental principles of society. Such a practice should
under no circumstances be tolerated. This practice should be
stopped. The trade should be killed. The courts should make
it their business to discourage this thing in a way that may
be easily understood."</p>

<p>Judge Kohlsaat, of Chicago, has inveighed against the practice
in equally vehement terms. Judge Kohlsaat declares that
"the Police Department of Chicago is entitled to great credit
for what it has done in discouraging this business. I hope it
will continue its vigilance until every promoter of marriages
of this character has been compelled to leave the city. They
should make such criminals give the city a wide berth."</p>

<p>There, then, is the law. The business is a crime in its very
nature. It leads to bigamy and wholesale murder. It is made
the instrument of the thief, the swindler and the murderer.
How much longer will the American people look with calmness
upon these practices, upon these abominations, which make a
stench of the very air of the great and free country in which
we live? The answer is up to you.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_GREAT_MISTAKE">THE GREAT MISTAKE.</a><br />

<small>OUR PENAL SYSTEM IS A RELIC OF EARLY SAVAGERY.</small></h2>


<p>Our whole penal system needs changing. It is a relic of
barbarism, and stands a monument to the early savagery of
the human race.</p>

<p>How is it possible for a man or woman to lead an upright,
useful life after they once come under the ban of the law?
Society combines to hound them down. They are forbidden
to place themselves on an equality with others by narrow,
human prejudice&mdash;the "holier than thou" attitude of that
portion of the public which has not yet been "found guilty."</p>

<p>We are Pharisees, all, and sit in judgment on our fellowman,
because we do not yet realize the mixture of evil and
good that is in every man&mdash;none are exempt&mdash;only some are
caught and punished.</p>

<p>Men have come to us, desperate, despairing men, crying:
"For God's sake, what are we to do? If we get a job someone
will tell our employers we have 'done time,' and we are
fired. If they find us on the street, we're arrested. Where
can we go and what can we do?"</p>

<p>A man may commit murder and not be a criminal, and
yet a sneakthief is always a criminal and every burglar a
potential murderer.</p>

<p>Social conditions produce criminals. As well expect a rose
to bloom in a swamp as human nature to flower in the slums.</p>

<p>All our prisons are hotbeds of tuberculosis and most prison
physicians hold their positions through political pull.</p>

<p>In our opinion a greater distinction should be made between
the penitentiary and house of correction. Petty misdemeanants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
should not be branded with the prison stigma. We also
favor suspended sentence for first offenders.</p>

<p>The crime and its punishment should be separated. At
present the personal equation does not enter into the case
when a judge imposes sentence. The man's environment, what
leads him to break the law, and how best to help this particular
man, all are questions that should be carefully considered
before sentence is pronounced.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Intelligence in Punishing Crime.</span></h3>

<p>A student of prison affairs once said that the prison population
consists of two classes&mdash;people who never ought to have
been sent to prison and people who never ought to be allowed
to leave it. It is unfortunate that students interested in either
one of these classes are too often apt to forget the importance
of the other.</p>

<p>There are many habitual criminals, weak persons readily giving
way to temptation, who should not be classified as professionals.
The professionals are only those who deliberately
set about supporting themselves by crime. These are the ones
who are among all criminals most unlikely to change their
ways, and it was for their control that Detective Wooldridge
suggested some years ago that after several convictions such
criminals should be given a special trial to decide whether they
were true professionals or not, and if they were, they should be
imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>If more attention were given to professional crime and if
harsher methods were used in protecting society from it, the
result would be merciful in the end&mdash;merciful both to the
citizens protected from such crime and to the men who, as
conditions now are, graduate every year into such careers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The "Silent System" is a Crime Against Criminals.</span></h3>

<p>The penitentiary for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
at Philadelphia, in 1907, was the only prison in America conducted
on what is known as the "silent system."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>In this grim edifice a man sentenced to twenty years imprisonment
might pass all of that time buried from sight in
his cell, seeing only his keeper, the chaplain, the doctor and
the schoolmaster, and for twenty minutes in every six weeks
he would be allowed to talk with a near relative.</p>

<p>This man loses his identity the moment he enters the prison
gates. A black cap is drawn over his head and he is led to
a cell in one of the many corridors that radiate from the
central tower like spokes from the hub of a wheel. He is
known thereafter by a number.</p>

<p>The cell in which he eats and sleeps and works is a little
larger than the average prison cell, and more completely furnished&mdash;as
it must hold his bed, his lavatory, his dishes and
a place for eating, his work, his every possession, and such
books as he may secure from the prison library.</p>

<p>His front door opens on a corridor and is kept ajar on
a heavy chain so the prison guards may watch him.</p>

<p>His back door opens on a plot of ground about 8×10 feet.
It is surrounded and cut off from all communication from
every living human being by a brick wall. Only the watchman
in the central tower and the birds that wing their way
over the prison can see him in his little yard. Robinson Crusoe
on his deserted island could not be more utterly lonely.</p>

<p>In this tiny yard is a circular path worn smooth and pressed
deep into the soil by the feet of despairing men&mdash;his predecessors.</p>

<p>The prisoner is forbidden even the negative pleasure of going
out into this God-forsaken walled plot of bare ground
except for one hour a day.</p>

<p>In his gloomy cell the prisoner drags out the "task" given
him to escape insanity. He fears to be idle without the sound
of a human voice in his ear or the sight of a human face to
relieve his awful loneliness.</p>

<p>To lengthen these "tasks" the State of Pennsylvania has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
provided primitive hand-looms, some 100 years old, and other
discarded makeshifts of man's industrial infancy.</p>

<p>Not for him has the world progressed beyond the caveman's
day. Perhaps he is a skilled mechanic, a man accustomed
to the swift play of machinery, the grip of tool on material.
He is condemned to manufacture by primitive methods
the clothes he wears to keep him from quite going mad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Extreme Methods Faulty.</span></h3>

<p>As between the abominable "contract" and "lease" systems
and this reversion to blind seclusion, is there no human method
to be found of apportioning the convict's labor?</p>

<p>Yet No. 99, locked away in his solitary cell in the Philadelphia
prison, must toil laboriously, denying his brain and
hand their cunning, with a pretense at occupation. He is not
sharing in the world's work. He knows this child's play of
making something that no one needs on an instrument left
over from the twelfth century is futile and foolish.</p>

<p>How shall he meet and battle with the great world of commerce
and labor after twenty years of this? In what way is
this make-believe fitting him for liberty?</p>

<p>Some few in the Philadelphia prison escape the fate mapped
out for them. There are 800 cells, and there are at present
about 1,100 prisoners. Naturally, some must "double up."
And then the regular domestic work of the institution must
be done, tasks at which it would be impossible to keep prisoners
separated or wholly silent.</p>

<p>And so the "silent system" is not entirely silent. But, we
protest, that is not the fault of the prison management, nor
is it that of the good citizens who seventy-eight years ago devised
and built this prison, the only one of its kind in
America.</p>

<p>Men are unfitted for after-life under the "silent system."
They come out of prison at the end of their terms with shuffling
gait and incoherent speech and unskilled hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut off from all obligation to family or friends, the prisoner's
whole spiritual nature is bound to deteriorate. Will
he be a better citizen, a more loving father or husband or son,
when he is released?</p>

<p>The prison at Philadelphia is a model of cleanliness, management,
discipline and sanitation. The warden, Charles C.
Church, is humane and intelligent; the guards above the average
in character.</p>

<p>And yet Pennsylvania's crime against her criminal population
is appalling. All she does for her unfortunate offender
is to guard him securely, shelter him in cleanliness, feed and
clothe him&mdash;and hold him against the day of his release.</p>

<p>These are necessary things, but it is more necessary that
the state turn back the criminal at least no worse than she
found him when committed to her care.</p>

<p>She could turn him out a better man morally, better equipped
to gain a livelihood, in fair physical health, and certainly
without mental taint or bias due to his imprisonment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jails Make 50,000 Criminals a Year.</span></h3>

<p>If the jails and lockups in our country&mdash;4,000 or 5,000 in
number&mdash;are in truth, as they have been often aptly termed,
in most cases compulsory schools of crime, maintained at the
public expense, we shall have from this quarter alone an accession
to the criminal classes in each decade of perhaps 50,000
trained experts in crime. Surely, almost any change in dealing
with the young, with the beginners in lawbreaking, would
be an improvement on the prevailing system. Jails and prisons,
so constructed and managed as to keep separate their inmates,
would afford an adequate remedy for the evil. Until
this can be done it would be far better to cut down largely
the number of arrests and committals of the young.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img066.jpg" width="600" height="399" alt="United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas; the
best and most modern Penitentiary in the United States if not in the
world." />
<div class="caption">United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas; the
best and most modern Penitentiary in the United States if not in the
world.</div>
</div>

<p>"It is absurd to argue that life in the penitentiary is conducive
to moral betterment, for all the conditions are against
this cheerful theory. In jail a man meets criminals. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
whole system makes for greater criminality on the release of
the prisoner. He has time to plan fresh onslaughts on society.
His incarceration further embitters him against the
world. He looks with malicious envy on those who have escaped
the punishment which he has had to suffer. When he
is turned out of prison he is ready for further felonies&mdash;only
now he has learned more caution, and for this reason he is
more dangerous than he was when he entered the institution."</p>

<p>When a man has served two prison sentences without being
convinced of the futility of the attempt to live without honest
work, it is evident that he has abandoned all idea of being
a good citizen and has made up his mind to prey upon
society.</p>

<p>"Then," says Mr. Wooldridge, "moderate sentences having
produced no good effect upon him, either to deter or reform,
why should he not be taken permanently out of society and
put where he cannot harm others or wrong himself by committing
crime? No objection," he concluded, "can be found
to this method."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crime Based on Suggestion.</span></h3>

<p>The man who has declared war upon the world, as every
man has done who is not reformed by two successive prison
sentences, should be seized and permanently imprisoned. Modern
thought does not sanction the literal translation of this
idea, but that does not interfere with the possibility of
carrying it out for the benefit of society.</p>

<p>The world spends millions of dollars every year in the business
of protecting itself against the criminal and in caring for
him. But that is because no serious attempt has ever been
made to solve the problem of crime.</p>

<p>Crime is largely a matter of suggestion and therefore if all
the habitual criminals in the country were segregated where
their influence would no longer be able to exert itself, crime
would not propagate itself so fast. The young men would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
not have presented to them so often or so forcibly the example
which causes most of them to take the crooked path. Thus
the expense of prevention would be enormously diminished at
once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suggests Great Prison Farm.</span></h3>

<p>With segregated criminals supporting themselves, as they
might be made to do under our plan, the enormous cost of
penitentiaries would at one step be done away with. A penal
colony such as Mr. Wooldridge proposed would be placed in
such a situation that the convicts could be compelled to raise
every bit of food they put into their mouths and every bit
of clothing they put upon their backs. Out in one of the
western states or territories a reservation might be made of
several thousand acres of land, around the rim of which the
convicts could be made to build a great wall shutting themselves
away from the rest of the world. On its surface would
be built in the same way habitations for them, and they would
live there, tilling the soil and manufacturing their necessities,
until death.</p>

<p>The time will come when this plan will be carried out. The
law-abiding citizens of the United States will not continue forever
to be taxed enormously for the support of a class of
persons who are enemies of public order and decency.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Improving the Public Health.</span></h3>

<p>Can a nation be said to be civilized that spends billions of
dollars every year in the detection and punishment of crime,
and not one cent for the prevention and cure of disease, which
kills thousands of persons who might otherwise have retained
their health and strength?</p>

<p>Suppose only a billion dollars a year, that now goes to the
support of criminals in jails and penitentiaries, were to be
saved by the establishment of a national penal colony where
criminals would be made to support themselves; and suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the billion dollars thus saved were to be spent on free hospitals
and medical treatment, would the country not be much
better off?</p>

<p>Such a use of the money would result in cutting down the
death rate in the United States at least one-half. The death
rate in England, through the exercise of care and the assistance
of the government, has been reduced from one-half to two-thirds
in many diseases, and ten to twelve years have been
added to the expectation of life between the ages of one year
and forty-five years. A similar state of affairs should exist in
this country, where the waste of life and health through preventable
diseases is incalculable.</p>

<p>Our enormous expense on account of criminals, most of
which might be avoided if brains were really brought to bear
upon the problem, will not always be endured. The future
will force the criminal to support himself, and the money now
expended on him will be devoted to the preservation of health
and life among honest men, for the time will certainly come
when free hospitals and medical service will be provided by
the government for every citizen who needs them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Road Work for Convicts.</span></h3>

<p>Criminology, on its humanitarian side, seeks new methods
of employment for criminals. It seeks to regenerate convicted
criminals morally, as well as care for their physical well-being.</p>

<p>Indoor prison trades have a deadly monotony. In most cases
they are carried on without sunlight, and with too little fresh
air. Confinement within walls is alone a heavy punishment,
but when allied with conditions that breed disease and possibly
death, society exacts more than just retribution.</p>

<p>Modern criminology leans toward both moral and physical
care in allotting the daily tasks of criminals. It assumes that
the state has no right to make the criminal a worse or a
weaker member of society than when he entered the prison
walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>This explains why most experts in criminology are strongly
in favor of putting criminals to work at road-making. Here
is employment in God's sunlight and air, where criminals can
do useful work, and still be under watchful guard. They will
be giving the state better highways, and at the same time escape
the deadly indoor prison grind.</p>

<p>Criminologists are studying a hundred speculative methods
of benefiting the criminal. They all agree on one point&mdash;namely,
that useful work in the open air is beneficial to the
average criminal, morally and physically.</p>

<p>If there can be a large benefit to the state, at the same
time that the state is benefiting the criminal, there is a double
advance along the lines of rational, humane treatment of
criminals.</p>

<p>The sordid idea that criminals should pay the cost of their
own incarceration is secondary. And yet, in applying convict
labor to the solution of the good roads problem in the
United States, the public would get back at least a portion of
the enormous drain on public revenues for the support of
criminals.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Solves "Good Roads" Problem.</span></h3>

<p>This is the only complete solution of the good roads problem.
It is one that all farmers or other rural residents should
insist upon. It is the one practical way of gridironing the
states, old and new, with good roads. It is especially vital in
the newer states, where the absence of good roads is the heaviest
tax on industry that individual communities must suffer.</p>

<p>It is far better for the criminals themselves that they should
be employed in this useful outdoor labor. The greatest clog
on the science of criminology is the aversion to breaking away
from traditions. The housing of criminals in penitentiaries,
where expensive idleness alternates with desultory forms of
industry, has ceased to be a method abreast of the times. There
is enormous waste in the orthodox prison systems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Get all able-bodied convicts into road-making for a single
generation, and what would result? The productiveness of
agricultural states would be vastly increased. Markets, for the
average farmer, would be easier of access. Instead of virtual
isolation for three or four months of the year, agricultural life
would be more evenly balanced.</p>

<p>The actual financial benefits to farmers would aggregate a
vast total.</p>

<p>In European countries, it took several generations to solve
the good-roads problem. But they have solved it. The rural
roads in the average European state or principality are a national
blessing. They are not only a joy to transient travelers,
but form the bulwark of agricultural industries. European
governments have wisely considered no cost too great
for good roads.</p>

<p>As distances are immeasurably greater in America than in
thickly settled European states, the good roads problem takes
on a different aspect here. American roads are, on the average,
worse than in any other civilized country. Therefore,
they must be built up, slowly and patiently, perhaps, but with
increasing energy as population grows denser.</p>

<p>With European methods it would take a hundred years to
give the western states good roads. With the convict labor, the
problem would be solved in twenty years or less. This would
suffice, at least, for a great national system of highways.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Extend the Parole System.</span></h3>

<p>The fear is expressed that an extension of the parole system
as regards adults would open a velvet path for criminals
to continue preying upon society. There was a loud hue and
cry raised against the idea as administered recently by one of
our Municipal Court Judges. Still, there is no denying that
there is a great deal of good resultant from this plan. It is a
safe, sane and conservative one, especially so when in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
hands of judges who can feel for the man who has committed
his first offense.</p>

<p>Chicago has some peculiar problems to contend with. It is
the stopping off place for all traveling from south to north, and
from north to south, and from west to east. Many of these
transient visitors live a hand-to-mouth life. Oftentimes they
are driven to crime by sheer force of necessity. Again, the
father or son may be out of work, and chance may place in
his way the opportunity to commit some petty theft, tempting
him on to his first crime. If such offenders show signs of
desiring to do better and are susceptible of reformation, they
ought to be given another chance. On the other hand, those
who are unmistakably guilty and evidence no signs of repentance
should be punished without any undue delay.</p>

<p>Many families have been driven to disgrace and ruin when
their heads were sent to prison. Surely among these there
were some who had manifested repentance and shown indications
of a desire to be given another opportunity to start anew;
surely had they but been shown lenience they might have proved
good citizens and worthy of the confidence reposed in them.</p>

<p>Of course, there are a lot of drawbacks to the parole system
as it applies to juveniles in Chicago. But free from politics
and in the hands of fair-minded, square-leading men it
would prove a splendid scheme worthy of the highest praise.
In its infancy it might look like a failure, but as time passed
it would be perfected, so that in the long run it would prove a
godsend to humanity.</p>

<p>When a criminal returns from penitentiary or prison he is
shunned by society; he is under the eternal vigilance of our
police force&mdash;he is walked upon and pushed down. Finally,
tired with trying to earn an honest living, he again resorts to
crime. Probably had he been paroled he might have turned
out a deserving citizen and the father of a happy family.</p>

<h3>WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE VAGRANT AND TRAMP?</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The vagrant is the most elusive man among us. He is
always with us, yet we can never locate him. No one wants him,
yet we always send him to someone else. We make laws to
get rid of him, but succeed only in keeping him a little longer
in custody at our own expense. Most of us laugh at him and
some of us cry over him by turns. We draw funny pictures
of him in our newspapers and in our billboard advertisements,
but we are really afraid of him. We blame the police for not
keeping him off the streets, or at least out of sight, and yet
we feed him at our own doors. We fear to meet him after
dark, and nevertheless we give him a nickel or a dime to
keep him in town over night. He is an object of charity, or
a criminal, just as we happen to feel. He is sometimes the
hero of our melodrama at the theater, who gets our tearful
applause. At the same time he stands for all that we brand
as mean and vile. We spend money lavishly to support him
without work by charity, or imprison him in idleness by law.</p>

<p>The problem is to understand vagrancy so well that we can
deal with it on a large enough scale both to restore the vagrant
to the working world or to keep him in custody, and to prevent
the accidental or occasional vagrant from becoming a habitual
mendicant. The English and European governments have dealt
with their problems of vagrancy more effectively than we have.
This is due to the fact that they have investigated the causes
and conditions of vagrancy more widely than we, and dealt
with it on a larger scale by uniform legislation and by more
persistently following up the measures in which the public
and private resources combine to treat the evil.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Tramp a Railroad Problem.</span></h4>

<p>Thus the tramp cuts no figure as a railroad problem, much
less menace, abroad. But with us it is the fact that railroads
representing more than half the total mileage operated in the
United States and Canada testify almost without exception to
depredation, thieving, injuries, deaths, accidents to passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
or rolling stock, enormous aggregate costs to railroads or society,
caused by the habitual illegal use of the railroads by
vagrants. The number of "trespassers," from one-half to three-quarters
of whom were vagrants, who are killed annually on
American railroads exceeds the combined total of passengers
and trainmen killed annually. Within four years 23,964 trespassers
were killed and 25,236 injured, thus furnishing the
enormous total of 49,200 casualties, with all the cost they involve.</p>

<p>Only by the co-operation of the railroads with one another
and of towns and cities with the railroads can this waste of
life and property and this increasing peril to the safety of
the traveling public be prevented. Much more stringent laws
will have to be both enacted and enforced to prevent the trespassing,
which puts a premium on vagrancy.</p>

<p>One of the best effects of the strict prevention of free riding
on railroads would be to keep boys from going "on the road"
and becoming tramps. It is simply amazing to find little
fellows of from 12 to 17 years of age, who have never been
farther away from home than to some outlying freight yards,
disappearing for several weeks and returning from Kansas
City, or Cleveland, Omaha or New York, having all alone,
or with a companion or two, beaten their way and lived by
their wits while traveling half way across the continent. Once
the excitement of the adventure is enjoyed, the hardship it
costs does not seem so hard to them as the monotony of home
or shop. The discipline of the United States navy has been
the only regulation of this wandering habit which the writer
has known to be successful. But the habit is more easily prevented
than regulated. Massachusetts has taken the most advanced
legislative action of all the states to this end. The
Wabash and the New York Central railways suggest fine and
imprisonment for trespassing upon railway tracks or rolling
stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Better Lodgings for Homeless Men.</span></h4>

<p>Far better provision for lodging homeless men must be made
by cities in municipal lodging houses of their own, such as
Chicago effectively conducts, and by far stricter public regulation
and supervision of lodging houses maintained for profit
or for charity. The anti-tuberculosis crusade shows that this
supervision and regulation should be shared by the health authorities
with the police. Within a period of five years 679
consumptives were taken from only a portion of Chicago's
lodging house district to the Cook County Hospital, most of
them in the most dangerously infectious stages of the disease.
An investigator of Chicago's 165 cheap lodging houses and
their 19,000 beds declares that "the unfortunate man forced
to sojourn in them for a while may enter sound and strong
and come out condemned to death."</p>

<p>The New York City Charity Organization Society and the
Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor have rendered
a country-wide public service in furnishing the report
on "Vagrancy in the United States" by their joint agent, Orlando
F. Lewis. It may well be the basis for better public
policy here and everywhere.</p>

<p>Startling figures and facts were presented at the State Conference
of Charities and Corrections at Albany by Arthur W.
Towne, secretary of the Illinois State Probation Commission,
regarding the extent of vagrancy and the habits of tramps in
this state.</p>

<p>More than 31,000 persons, mainly vagrants, received free
lodgings in New York State, in town and city lockups, during
1906, and the number in 1907 was larger. Seventy-five cities
and towns thus provide for their wandering visitors. Half of
these towns and cities also feed the wanderers free of charge.</p>

<p>A large number of places give lodgings also to boys, many
of them as young as 10 or 12 years, thus encouraging the
wandering spirit that makes the later tramp. With only one
slight exception, not a single town or city required any work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
at all from the lodgers in return for the lodging or the food
provided, thus giving absolutely no incentive to the wanderer
to work for his board or meals.</p>

<p>It is urged that the system of allowing the police authorities
to give these free lodgings, as well as the similar practice
in some jails and almshouses, be abolished as a most direct
encouragement to vagrancy, and that in their stead such free
lodgings as are necessary should be furnished by the overseer
of the poor, but only when repaid by some form of work,
such as chopping wood or breaking stone.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Tramps Like Jail.</span></h4>

<p>Mr. Towne also brought out the fact that tramps like to go
to jail in winter. Instead of considering a jail sentence for
that part of the year as a form of punishment, they welcome
it as a chance to keep warm and loaf at the public expense.
Forty-three per cent of the commitment of tramps occurs between
November 1 and February 1. In short, the jail or the
penitentiary becomes a sort of winter vacation resort for tramps.
Many chiefs of police with whom Mr. Towne communicated
said that tramps in winter would ask to be sent to jail, and
that if this were not done they would sometimes commit offenses
for the express purpose of being arrested and sent there.</p>

<p>It is declared to be significant that in the tramp's slang the
word "dump" is applied to both lodging houses and jails.</p>

<p>With a cold winter the number of vagrants in penitentiaries
and jails increases. In 1906 there were more than 10,000
tramps and vagrants in penitentiaries and jails, while in 1904,
which was a very cold winter, there were more than 14,000.
On the average, about one-third of the prisoners are tramps
and vagrants. This means that the public is annually paying
several hundred thousand dollars for the avowed purpose of
punishing men for vagrancy, but in reality it amounts only
to furnishing a free place of winter rest. Most of the chiefs
of police believe that jails and penitentiaries do little good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
if any, in their treatment of tramps. Another fact is that the
sentences for this class of offenders are too short to accomplish
any results. About 85 per cent of the sentences are from only
one to sixty days.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hobos Classified by Races.</span></h4>

<p>In a vague way the veteran hobos, classified by the various
nationalities, are fairly representative of the make-up of the
whole American nation, in accordance with the number of
hobos each nationality turns out. After taking into consideration
the fact that certain parts of the United States are
dominated by people of one nationality, and the bulk of tramps
in that part of the country would necessarily come from that
nationality, the following classification was given as doing
justice to all:</p>

<p>The Irish and British elements lead in the number of hobos.
They are closely followed, however, by the German element.
The nations of Eastern Europe, Poles, Bohemians, Hungarians
and others, are next in line. Then follow, in smaller numbers,
Scandinavians, French, Italians and Jews. The French come
mostly from Canada, the Scandinavians from the northwest
and the Italians from the largest cities in the country, like
New York and Chicago, and also from the southern states.
Here and there one finds a stray Servian or Bulgarian who
drifted into trampdom and has never been able or has never
cared to drift out of it again.</p>

<p>Greeks are seldom found among tramps because they have
not yet a "second generation" of Greeks to any extent in the
United States. Chinese and Japanese likewise are not found
in the hobo class. Of the negro race, many would not be
averse to becoming professional tramps were it not for the
risk which a negro tramp generally runs. A "stray negro,"
according to the hobos interviewed, is regarded with apprehension
and is apt to be shot on mere suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">New Foreigner Not a Hobo.</span></h4>

<p>You will hardly ever find a foreigner in the first five or
ten years of his American life among tramps and hobos. "He
may be near tramp, he may be apparently 'down and out,'
but he is not a genuine hobo," said one of the men. "You
will find plenty of foreigners in the lodging houses, plenty
of them who starve and suffer, but they are not hobos. They
have had hard luck, and now in their old age they live by
doing two or three and some even one day's work a week.
But they work more or less. They have not the parasitic philosophy
of one who is a full-fledged hobo. They fall more in the
class of European vagabonds, such as one finds in Germany
or Russia. They work now and then; they have some trade,
or know a smattering about a number of trades."</p>

<p>The American hobo falls in an entirely different category
from these. Work with him is said to be a disgrace. Neither
does he relish crime much if he can get along without it. He
will beg from door to door and will commit a crime only as a
last resort. The hobo primarily has no will power, or rather,
he destroys it.</p>

<p>The majority of hobos became such because of their false
conception of freedom and of wrong inter-relations between
parents and children. Their parents have been held in many
cases in semi-savage conditions by their landlords in the old
world. When they come to America they naturally appreciate
their freedom. They speak of it to their children. They are
lax with them, and this spoils them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Jew Recruit in Trampdom.</span></h4>

<p>Polish tramps and tramps from other nations of Eastern
and Southern Europe were declared to be more apt to turn
to petty crimes when pressed to it by want. They are, however,
according to statements of tramps, easily found out.
They somehow are hasty in their actions, and just as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
brandish their knives and pistols thoughtlessly they fall into
the hands of the police simply and easily.</p>

<p>The Jewish tramp was a rarity until recently. However,
the large number of Jews which poured into this country from
oppressed countries in Europe since 1881 have also furnished
a "first generation," many of whose members have found
their way to the barrel houses and slums of all large cities.
The Jewish tramp, however, was declared to be entirely of
the class of the petty criminal. Out of the penitentiary for
some petty crime committed, or having been a go-between for
thieves and the person who buys the goods stolen, the Jewish
youth for the time being takes to trampdom.</p>

<p>His commercial instinct, however, together with the wide
system of charity which the Jews maintain in every city where
they are found, soon enables him to get out of the hobo class.
He becomes a trader of some sort and soon leaves the barrel
house and his hobo companions behind him.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Talks of the Tramp&mdash;Why Dilapidated Gentleman Does
Not Give Up Wandering and Settle Down&mdash;Likes the
Care-Free Life&mdash;Mingles Among the People and Gets
to Know Them Well&mdash;Changes in Community.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Why don't I give it up and settle down in city or village
and become a respectable member of the community?" echoed
the dilapidated gentleman as he pocketed his usual fee. "I
have been asked that question a thousand times, it seems to
me, and my answer has always been the same. I tramp as a
profession, and I stand at the head of it. I like it. There's
a good living in it. I come in contact with human nature
at every turn. I am respectable as it is. The cities and villages
are overcrowded, and the man who butts in has little
chance of success. I have less to worry about and sleep more
soundly than any business man in America. You newspaper
fellers think you know it all, but you'd take a drop to yourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
if you were on the tramp for a month. You'd see more
human nature with the bark on in that time than you can find
on the East Side in New York in five years.</p>

<p>"Say, now," continued the man, "can you name me one
single newspaper in the state of New York that felt sure of
Roosevelt's election as governor? No, you can't. I hit his majority
within 2,000. Why? Because I was among the people
and knew how they talked. Plenty of politicians and newspapers
said he'd be elected as president when he ran, but no
man or no newspaper came within a thousand miles of the
popular majority. I don't say that I hit it, but I could have
given pointers to a hundred editors.</p></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Get Out Among the People.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Before the next national convention of either party meets
I'll have tramped over three or four states, and I'll be ready to
wager my life ag'in a nickel that I can name the victorious
candidate. I'll wager that I can predict it far closer than
any newspaper in the land. If you want to know what this
country is thinking about, my boy, don't box yourself up in
a sanctum and read a few exchanges. Get out and rub elbows
with the people. It isn't the few big cities that settle the
great political questions. It's the farmer and the villager, and
they come pretty near being dead right every time. When I
had tramped across seven counties of New York state I shouted
for Hughes. A politician in Syracuse who heard me had me
thrown out of a meeting and wanted the police to arrest me.
I heard that he had a bet of $5,000 on another candidate and
was predicting Hughes' defeat by 50,000. But enough of this.
I'
ll switch off and tell you something that has hurt me for
the last three or four years.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Barns Now Locked.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Do you know that a few men, comparatively, have almost
changed the nature of the country and village population?
No, you don't, but you'll learn of it some day through some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
magazine writer who gathers up his points in the way I have.
Time was when not one farmer in ten in the land locked his
house or barn at night. Now ninety out of a hundred do it.
When a stranger came along they welcomed him. When a
man talked with them they accepted his statement. What they
saw in the newspapers they believed without cavil. Well, they
have got over all this. The patent medicine faker, the mine
exploiter, the bucketshop man and the hundreds of other
swindlers have destroyed the confidence of the farmer and
villager in human nature. They have been bitten so often
and so hard that they come to doubt if such a thing as honesty
exists. They won't take a stranger's word for anything. They
have got through believing that there is an honest advertiser.
They have even become distrustful of each other. It has become
the hardest kind of work to sell a windmill, piano or
other articles direct.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Victims of Fakers.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You can't get out into the country and walk five miles without
finding a victim of the fakers. The farmer has invested
in bogus mines, bogus oil wells, bogus stock and bogus other
things, and not only lost his money, but come to know that
he was as good as robbed of it. The villager has been trapped
the same way. It has hardened their hearts and given them
the worst view of mankind. You can know nothing of this
by telling, nor of the ruin wrought until you get among the
people.</p>

<p>"Up to a year or so ago it was seldom that a farmer turned
me down. If he had nothing for me to do to earn a meal
or lodging he would not turn me away. He most always took
me on trust and had no fear that I was a rascal in disguise.
It's all changed now. This last summer I was paddling the
hoof in Connecticut and Massachusetts, making a sort of grand
farewell tour, and it was hard work for me to even get a
few apples of the farmers. They used to be full of 'chin' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
gossip. They used to hold me for an hour in order to hear
all the news. I found them last summer sullen and sulky
and calling to me from the fields to move on. In other years
the village landlord would set me at work in the stables or
with a pail of whitewash in some of the rooms, and in that
way I'd pay for my stay. I found a change there.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hardened by Losses in "Prosperity" Times.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Three years ago, if you had started out for a day's tramp
with me along a country road every farmer we met would
have had a 'Howdy' for us, and perhaps stopped for a chin.
You'd have heard whistling or singing from every man at
work, and the farmer's wife would have called to you that she
had some fresh buttermilk. Take such a tramp today and
you'll find a tremendous change. I can't estimate the sum
the farmers and villagers have been robbed of during the past
years of prosperity, but it is something appalling for the whole
country. As much and more has been taken out of victims in
the cities, but the case is different. The man in the city
doesn't pin his faith to an advertisement. He speculates on
chance. He is where he can use the law, if needs be. If he
loses here he goes at it to get even there. With the other
class it is a dead loss, and the swindler can give them the
laugh. Take almost any highway you will, leading through
almost any state, and eight farmers out of ten have been made
victims. Even the man who has not lost above $10 has been
hardened by it.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">His Feelings Hurt.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I said that this change hurt me, and so it does. You may
be surprised to hear that anything can hurt the feelings of a
tramp, but that is because you don't know him. He is looked
upon as an outlaw in the cities, but ever since he took the road
there has been a sort of bond between him and the dwellers
outside. He has paid his way or been willing to. He has
asked for little and done little harm. The newspapers have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
thousands of farmers tell hard stories about the tramp, but
it has been in the newspapers alone. The two have worked
together harmoniously.</p>

<p>"Have you got any idea of how the professional conducts
himself on the road? No? Well, it won't happen once in a
week that you will find one without a little money. It has
been earned by hard work. When he stops at a farmhouse
he offers to work for a meal. If there is no work he pays cash
for what he gets. If he has been padding along for three
or four days he will stop and work for half a week if the
chance is offered him. In his work he keeps up with the hired
man. He washes before he eats. He knows what forks are
made for. He carries a clean handkerchief oftener than the
man he works for. The average tramp can dress a chicken,
kill a pig, empty and fill a straw bed, whitewash a kitchen,
paint the house or fence, hoe corn, dig potatoes, run a cultivator,
drive a team, split fence rails, dig a well, shingle a
roof or rebuild a chimney. He is a handy man. He eats
what he gets, sleeps where he is told to and brings the farmer
a bigger budget of news than any two of his county papers.
When his work is finished he slings his hook and is told to stop
again. That's the tramp and that's the farmer just as they
have been for the last forty years, and that's the reason I
bemoan this change in the farmer. He has been victimized by
men he thought were honest, he has been robbed where he
trusted, and in changing his feelings toward mankind he must
include the tramp, who has never wronged him.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Driven to the Cities.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Take a walk and you will find those same green meadows,
those same brooks, those same lambs, but you won't find Uncle
Josh and Aunt Mary any more. A city like this seems a hard-hearted
and cruel place, and you shiver at the idea of being dead
broke. Let me just tell you that tramps are driven into the cities
to recuperate. All the clothing I have had for the last five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
years has been begged in the city. All the money I have had
has come from the dwellers therein. The only kind words I
have heard have come from the hurly-burly. Makes you open
your eyes, doesn't it? You are still clinging to the old-fashioned
ideas of the country.</p>

<p>"My friend, let me tell you something. There isn't today
a harder man to deal with than the average farmer. There
isn't a woman with less sentiment than his wife. There's been
a mighty change in the last twenty years. Indeed, it is a
change that was forced on the farmer to protect himself. In
years gone by, in tramping over the highways, I have met
lightning-rod men, windmill men, piano men, hay-fork men,
commission men, peddlers, chicken buyers and horse traders.
All were after the farmer. Each and every one intended to
beat him, and did beat him. He was beaten when he sold his
produce and he was beaten when he bought his goods. He
was considered fair game all around. It was argued that his
peaceful surroundings made him gullible, and I guess they
did.</p></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Things Are Changed Now.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Well, Uncle Josh and Aunt Mary died twenty years ago,
and their children took hold. The babbling brook babbles for
cash now. The green meadows mean greenbacks. The lambkins
frisk, but they frisk for the dough. The watchdog at
the gate can size up a swindler as well as a man. The
farmer holds on until he gets the highest price, and the merchant
who sells him shoddy has got to get up early in the
morning. Say, now, but I'd rather start out to beat ten
men in a city than one farmer. I'd rather be dead broke here
than to have a dollar in my pocket out in the country. If
taken ill here I'm sent to a free hospital; if taken sick in the
country, the Lord help me.</p>

<p>"I'm not blaming the farmer in the least. For a hundred
years he was the prey for swindlers and was taken for a fool.
If he's got his eyes opened at last and is taking care of himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and I assure you that such is the case, then so much the
better for him. It is the dilapidated gentleman who suffers
most from this change.</p>

<p>"Why is a sailor a sailor? Nineteen times out of twenty
it is because he wants to rove the seas. Why is a tramp a
tramp? Nineteen times out of twenty it is because he wants
to rove the land. It is a nervous, restless feeling that he cannot
withstand. He wants to get somewhere, and he is no sooner
there than he wants to get somewhere else. The majority of
them are sober men. They are as honest as the average. Not
one in twenty will refuse to work for a meal or for pay. Not
one in twenty commits a crime for which he should be jailed.
You can't make statistics talk any other way. The whining,
lying, vicious tramp has his home in the city and stays there.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Farmers Down on Tramps.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is the press of the country that has got the farmer down
on the tramp. You may drive for fifty miles and interview
each farmer as you come to him and you won't find five to
say that a tramp ever caused them any trouble. In summer
the tramp may steal a few apples or turnips. Anyone driving
along the highway is free to do that. Should he steal an ax,
shovel, plow, sheep, calf or break into the house and steal
a watch or clothes, what is he going to do with his plunder?
The instant he tries to realize on it he is nabbed. The tramp
who entered a house and stole $50 in cash would be worse off
than if he hadn't a cent.</p>

<p>"I can walk into that bakery over there and say that I am
hungry and the woman will give me a stale loaf. I can tackle
most any man passing here for a dime for lodgings and get
it. I can wander down most any residence street and raise a
hat, a coat or a pair of shoes. How is it out in the country?
We'll say I've hoofed it all day, making about fifteen miles.
I've stopped to rest now and then and view the scenery. Don't
you make any mistake about that scenery feature. If any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
art company wanted to publish a thousand views it couldn't
do better than to ask the tramps where to find the best ones.
For lunch I pull two turnips from a field. My drink is
from a brook. Along about 6 o'clock I hunger for cooked
victuals, and as it looks like rain I would like to get lodgings
in a barn. I turn aside to a farmhouse. The farmer is washing
his hands at the well to go in to supper. Out of the tail
of his eye he sees me approaching, but he pays no heed until
I stand before him and say:</p>

<p>"'Mister, I can milk a cow, chop wood, mow weeds or hoe
If you will give me supper and lodgings on
the haymow I will work an hour at anything you wish.'</p></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Suspicious of Caller.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'When did you get out of jail?' he asks.</p>

<p>"'I have never been in jail.'</p>

<p>"'But you look like a durned skunk who stole a pitchfork
from me last year.'</p>

<p>"'Last year I was in California.'</p>

<p>"'Want to set my barn afire with your old pipe, do you?'</p>

<p>"'I don't smoke.'</p>

<p>"He stands and thinks a moment and then grudgingly tells
me to take a seat on the kitchen doorsteps. The wife brings
me out a stingy supper. There's an abundance on the table
and part of it will go to the hogs, but she cuts me short, thinking
to get ahead of me. I have cleared my plate in ten minutes
and then I am set to work and buckle in until too dark to see
longer. My bed is on the hay, and twice during the night
the farmer comes out to see if I haven't stolen the shingles off
the roof. In the morning if I want a meager breakfast I
must put in a good hour's work for it. That means an hour
and a half, and when I thank the farmer for his generosity
and get ready to go on, he says:</p>

<p>"'Goin', eh? Well, that's the way with you durned critters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
I've filled you up and lodged you, and now you want to play
the sneak on me.'</p>

<p>"My friend, don't look for much sentiment in humanity these
days, and don't look for a bit of it out in the country. You
won't find it. The farmer can't afford it. He has been beaten
by sharpers and squeezed by trusts until he has lost faith in
everyone. He has buttermilk, but it's for sale, and before
selling it to you he wants a certificate that you have never
stolen a haystack or run away with a field of buckwheat."</p></div>

<p>It was hard to suspect that the clean-cut, energetic and
rapid-fire talker was a tramp, but when he produced credentials
from one end of the country to the other, and promised
and threatened to produce them from Brazil, Hungary, New
Zealand and the Klondike regions to prove his statement, it
had to be credited.</p>

<p>"I'm A No. 1, the well-known hobo, tramp, author and
traveler," he said, in a speed of diction that would have made
the late lamented Pete Daily or Junie McCree green with envy.
"Everywhere you've seen the marks 'A. No. 1,' on railroad
fences, in railroad yards, or anywhere else, and you must have
seen them if you've been over this country much; you'll know
I've been there."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hobo Looks Like Business Man.</span></h4>

<p>A No. 1 had uttered this sentence in almost one breath, and
was proceeding with such rapidity that it was impossible to
follow his flow of ideas. He was a medium-sized but lithe
and powerfully built man, attired in a neat tailor-made brown
suit, with highly polished shoes, and looking something like
a prosperous business man in a small way. Under his arm he
carried a pair of blue overalls, and as he laid them on the
table he remarked: "My traveling rig."</p>

like it. When did I start? When I was 11 years old. What
is my name? None but myself knows it. I call myself A No. 1
because I'm an A. No. 1 tramp."</p>

<p>He had a most convincing way with him and proceeded to
spin off a tale of his adventures which differed somewhat from
the ordinary story that the average tramp will tell you; how
he had been hounded by the police, or released from jail and
couldn't get work, or had bad luck in business, being crushed
out by the heartless trusts until he had to tramp or starve, ending
up with an appeal for the "price of a bed, mister."</p>

<p>"I've kept a record of the towns I've been in ever since I've
been on the road," continued A. No. 1. "and up to date I've
traveled 445,405 miles, and it's cost me just $7.61. Out of that
distance there's been 92,000 miles of it by water. In 1906
I traveled 19,335 miles for 26 cents, and in the year 1907 I
traveled between Stamford and West Haven, Conn. I jumped
a street car and the conductor made me pay my fare. Oh, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
always have a little money, and I'm honest, too, and that's
saying a good deal for a tramp. Of course, once in a while
I go hungry, but that's when I can't get a potato."</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>"Is that your staple article of diet?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't eat them except in restaurants," said A. No. 1,
seriously. "Here is what I do with them." He pulled a good-sized
tuber from his pocket, opened a large clasp knife and
speedily had it peeled. Then he proceeded to cut and carve,
and in about three minutes had fashioned a grotesque human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
face on the potato, the lines coarse, to be sure, but nevertheless
well outlined.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Tramp An Artist.</span></h4>

<p>"I make these and can carve anyone's face, and I can sell
them anywhere from 25 cents to $2," said the tramp. "I'm the
only man in this country who can do such work, and there's
a demand for it everywhere I stop long enough to do it. I
only stop to do it when I have to, so that I can get a little
money for a meal and pay little expenses, although my living
doesn't cost me much. Then, again, I never drink or smoke,
so that item is cut off. They don't know so much about me
in Chicago as in other places, because I never stopped here
long enough to get acquainted; but they know me back East, all
right, and out in the West."</p>

<p>Then A. No. 1 paused long enough to draw his breath and
showed a medal certifying that in 1894 he had hoboed his
way across the continent in eleven days and six hours in company
with the representative of an Eastern paper and had
been given $1,000 for doing it.</p>

<p>"That's how I first became famous," he said, "but I took
good care of the money. I went and bought myself a lot in a
graveyard at Cambridge Springs, Pa., so I could be buried
respectably when I die, and I paid part of the premium on a
sick benefit so that I can be taken care of in case I fall sick
suddenly. I'm a member of the Chamber of Commerce of
that town, too. I believe in looking out for A. No. 1, and that's
why I've been so prosperous in the tramping way."</p>

<p>Then A. No. 1 launched into a long and picturesque description
of the ways of tramps in general and himself in particular.</p>

<p>"I've always been particular about some things," said he,
"and one is to keep clean. I find that in asking for a handout
the man who looks up-to-date is the man who gets it. I always
wear a suit of overalls when I'm tramping, for I find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
it prevents me from being annoyed by watchmen in railroad
yards. I am generally taken for an engineer. While I was
down in a yard here in Chicago one man came and asked if I
had a car lock, thinking I was a railroad man. I told him
I did not have one and walked off. I have prevented a number
of train wrecks, tramping about, probably at least one every
year. The last one, as you see by this letter, was a few months
ago. I saw a freight running along with a broken truck dragging.
I jumped aboard and gave the warning, as you can see
by this clipping. I have also been in a number of wrecks myself,
and have never been injured. I always carry a little
bottle of cyanide of potassium in my pocket so that in case I
am ever fatally injured and in great agony I can take it and
end all my trouble in about 20 seconds."</p>


<h3>COLONIES FOR TRAMPS.</h3>

<h4>Teaching Vagrants a Trade.</h4>

<p>The vagrancy problem, growing so great in every part of
the country, has caused the authorities of Massachusetts to
make a trial of the German plan of farm colonies for quasi-criminals.
Vagrants are sent to such farms under indeterminate
sentences, forced to support themselves by honest labor and
made to stay there until they give evidence that upon release
they will become useful and self-respecting citizens.</p>

<p>This is a modification of the penal colony idea, which is
to send confirmed criminals to such a place for life. It is
a great advance upon the plan in use in Chicago, which is
to send vagrants to the Bridewell for a stipulated time and
let them out again. While they are confined they are an expense
to honest citizens, they acquire more extensive knowledge
of crime, and when released they are less likely than they were
beforehand to go to work and support themselves.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts scheme promises well, so far as it goes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
The trouble with it is that in this climate a farm provides
work for only a small part of the year. From November to
March other work would have to be found for inmates, and
up to this time society has failed to agree upon any that would
be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Persons interested in charities and prison reforms are indorsing
a plan for "tramp colonies," "forced colonies" and
"free colonies." Into the one put criminals, or incurable
tramps who are unwilling to work. The other would contain
tramps who are unable to find work, neuropaths, cripples and
those who are judged to be curable. Both kinds of colonies
would be strictly agricultural, and their products would pay
all expenses of operation and relieve the country of the enormous
sums now required to be spent.</p>

<p>But why confine this plan, admirable and satisfactory as it
is, to tramps? Why not extend it so as to include criminals?
Criminals cost honest taxpayers millions of dollars every year.
Why not reorganize a system of confinement in such a way
as to compel criminals to support themselves?</p>

<p>But financial relief is not the only advantage. If habitual
criminals&mdash;that is to say, criminals who have served two terms
in the penitentiary, and then have committed another crime&mdash;were
placed in a penal colony, remote from society and kept
there for life, the moral tone of the country would at once
be raised. The bad example of such men, which leads youths
into crime, would be removed. The knowledge that there was
no escape, that return was impossible, once an offender was
sent to the penal colony, would deter many would-be criminals.
The possibility that hardened criminals might propagate
themselves would end.</p>

<p>The penal colony is the one rational solution of the crime
problem, which becomes more difficult and menacing each year.
It will be adopted, sooner or later.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_YOUNG_CRIMINAL">THE YOUNG CRIMINAL</a><br />

<small>HOW HE IS BRED IN CHICAGO.</small></h2>


<p class="center"><b>Chicago Raises Its Own Criminals.</b></p>

<p>There is material in this subject for earnest thought. Men
under twenty-five are responsible for 75 per cent of crimes
committed in Chicago, and 50 per cent of robberies and
burglaries are done by boys under nineteen.</p>

<p>If that is true, then the idea many people have had that
crimes in this city are mostly committed by a roving army
of criminals, alien to Chicago and attracted hither by one
cause or another, must be abandoned. If it is true, then Chicago
itself is responsible for most crimes committed here. The
men who are guilty have grown up in this environment, which
has given them the evil impetus under which they act.</p>

<p>The thought that Chicago boys are the criminals who terrorize
the city, rob houses and flats, hold up citizens on the
streets and assault women is distressing. It was much pleasanter
to attribute these crimes to desperate men from elsewhere,
descending upon Chicago like raiders and leaving the
city again as soon as possible. But that is a misconception.
We ourselves have reared most of our criminals. They are a
Chicago product. They have received their notions of right
and wrong here among us. We are responsible for them.</p>

<p>What is the matter with Chicago? What are the elements in
its life that breed criminals? What causes thousands of young
boys to take up a criminal life? What must we do to change
conditions?</p>

<p>These are questions that should engage every good citizen
in anxious endeavor to find answers to them. If we are to
reform criminals and lessen crime, we must first learn how to
reform our own city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preventing Crime Better Than Cure.</span></h3>

<p>Instead of attempting to prevent crime, we wait until after
the crime is committed, then burden ourselves with the expense
of apprehending, trying, convicting and imprisoning the
criminal.</p>

<p>Our first duty is to adopt those measures that will prevent
the further commission of crime.</p>

<p>Among the problems of Chicago there is no one, perhaps,
that is more baffling than that of the vicious boy.</p>

<p>His years protect him from the rigors of the law, and it is
a difficult matter to know just what to do with him.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of organizations formed for his aid and
his reformation. There is the Juvenile Court, for instance,
and there are innumerable homes and shelters, and still the
problem is not solved. The boy looms large in the public eye
these days, when he is sent to prison for life for murder and
spends long years in durance for burglary and other serious
crimes.</p>

<p>The story of the car-barn bandits and their tragic end is too
recent to need more than a passing reference.</p>

<p>The car-barn bandits met an ignominious death on the
gallows. Rudolph Gamof will spend the remainder of his
years behind prison bars and it is quite likely Alfred Lafferty
will know what hard work means in Pontiac or some other
such institution before he is once more at liberty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The End of the Gamin.</span></h3>

<p>It will be remembered that little Gavroche, the gamin in
"Les Miserables," came to his death on a barricade in the
streets of Paris. It was during the fatal insurrection of 1830.
The lad allied himself with the insurrectionists and found he
was in his element. He did prodigies of valor and was robbing
the dead bodies of the enemy of cartridges when he was
shot. Even after he had been shot once and had fallen to the
earth he raised himself to a sitting posture and began to sing
a revolutionary song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"He did not finish," says Hugo. "A second bullet from the
same marksman stopped him short. This time he fell face
downward on the pavement and moved no more. This grand
little soul had taken flight."</p>

<p>Thus it is to be seen that Hugo has made a hero of this
lad. But what of the little gamins that throng Chicago's
streets? Will they find any such glorious end? It is not
likely.</p>

<p>Jacob Leib is but 17 years old, and Alfred Lafferty, accused
of twenty-three burglaries, is only 16. The John Worthy
School is full of boys who have been gathered in by the police;
the Junior Business Club, another reform organization, has
a big membership, and the Juvenile Protective League is hard
at work trying to do something to arrest the boy in his mad
race to the reform school, prison and the penitentiary.</p>

<p>In looking about for the causes of crime among boys I
found that poverty, liquor, divorce, yellow newspapers, cigarettes
and bad company played important parts. Certain streets of
Chicago are schools of crime, where boys are taught the rudiments
of larceny and soon become adepts.</p>

<p>Hardened criminals use the more agile youths they find
idle to do work they are unable to do. Certain sections of
the city swarm with boys who are steeped in vice and crime
and are in embryo the murderers, the burglars and the forgers
of tomorrow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicago Has Her Children.</span></h3>

<p>Turning again to the pages of "Les Miserables," the story
of Gavroche, the gamin of Paris, may easily be found, and
the tale of this youth is not far different from that of the
"kid" of Chicago. Here is what Victor Hugo says of Gavroche
in that section of his great novel called "Marius": "This
child was muffled up in a pair of man's trousers, but he did
not get them from his father, and a woman's chemise, but he
did not get it from his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity.
Still he had a father and a mother. But his father did
not think of him and his mother did not love him.</p>

<p>"He was one of those children most deserving of pity, among
all; one of those who have father and mother and who are
orphans nevertheless.</p>

<p>"This child never felt so well as when he was in the street.
The pavements were less hard to him than his mother's heart.</p>

<p>"His parents had dispatched him into life with a kick. He
simply took flight.</p>

<p>"He was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wideawake, jeering
lad, with a vicious but sickly air. He went and came, sang,
played, scraped the gutters, stole a little, but like cats and
sparrows. He had no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love. When
these poor creatures grow to be men the millstones of the
social order meet them and crush them, but so long as they
are children they escape because of their smallness."</p>

<p>This is a true picture of the urchin of Chicago. These
tiny atoms of humanity are sponges that absorb all the filth,
the vice, the sin and the crime of the streets. They pick
up all that is evil and nothing that is good. They are nurtured
at the breast of poverty and viciousness, and are reared
on a diet of depravity and degradation. There is nothing
they do not know of crime and of wickedness. They are
thoroughly saturated with everything that is evil, unprincipled
and debased.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder, then, that the city brings forth an appalling
annual crop of criminals? There may be heroes among the
gamins in Chicago, but most of them are only heroes so long
as they remain uncaught.</p>

<p>When they fall into the hands of the police and are taken
to jail they are sorry-looking heroes.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the problem of the boy is still unsolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Graduate of the Streets.</span></h3>

<p>This, then, is a good specimen of the kind of boy the schools
of the street graduate. From these petty classes of crime they
go to the high school, the prison, where they are further
grounded in the knowledge of wickedness, and as like as not
return to Chicago once more, full-fledged criminals, ready for
anything. But this is only one of hundreds of such cases
that are brought to the attention of the police and the public
every year.</p>

<p>Most of the boys who come here are either orphans or half
orphans. Drink has wrecked their homes, perhaps, and they
are thrown out on the world to shift for themselves. If they
get into bad company they soon make their appearance in
the Juvenile Court or in jail.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">10,000 Boys Worse Than Homeless.</span></h3>

<p>A charitable worker who has come in touch with the young
of the poorer districts, whence comes the tough lad, estimates
that there are over 10,000 boys in Chicago who are worse than
homeless. In other words, they are in direct line of becoming
criminals or public charges, under the teaching of the trained
criminal who makes the city his refuge.</p>

<p>Anderson, the stickup youth who operated extensively on the
north side, choosing women for his victims, is but 23 years
old. The men who relieved Alderman C. M. Foell at the point
of a gun are less than 20, and thus it goes down the line.</p>

<p>They laugh at the efforts of the police to catch them. For
the most part they live at home or with relatives, and in
the neighborhoods are known as dissipated and tough boys, but
not as hold-up men. With companions they sally out at night
to isolated sections of the city where they know the police
protection to be inadequate. They choose secluded spots offering
the protection of darkness and lay in wait.</p>

<p>Then, with plenty of time deliberately to stop the victim
and take from him valuables, they operate until it is time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for the policeman to be in the vicinity, or until the profits
of the expedition are sufficient to satisfy their spirit of revelry
and riot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Schools for Pickpockets.</span></h3>

<p>There are numerous places in Chicago where boys are taught
to become pickpockets. Poolrooms are gathering places for
such young criminals and certain saloons of a low order harbor
others. There is one saloon in West Madison street, for instance,
not far from Canal street, where a lot of pickpockets
are in the habit of congregating. They are young fellows for
the most part and adepts in their particular field.</p>

<p>They find a sort of home in this saloon, where they can
get a big glass of beer and a generous free lunch for 5 cents.
They are in and out of this place day and night and manage
to keep out of the clutches of the law through their sleekness
and cleverness. There is one young man in there at least
who has made a good living by forging orders for goods. So
far he has escaped detection.</p>

<p>His method is to forge an order on some big business house
and get certain goods. One day he got a lot of belting from
a well-known firm on a forged order. He sold this later and
realized $4.50 on the deal. This he spent freely in the saloon
mentioned and made no bones of how he got the money. Others
run out, snatch a pocketbook and make for cover. Later on
they look up their cronies at the saloon and spend the money
for beer and cheap whisky, and eat free lunch provided by
the management.</p>

<p>There are numerous other such places, more especially on
South Clark near Van Buren street. Some of the saloons in
that section are alive with young fellows who prey upon the
public for a living. They do not always beg their way, either,
for they often take a run out and stick up somebody, filch a
purse or break into a store. When one of them has been up
to some devilment his companions can usually detect it, for
he will come back and be very flush for a few hours, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
few days, all depending, of course, upon how much he was
able to steal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Modern Boys Are Gamblers.</span></h3>

<p>But it is not only in the slums that the tendencies of the
modern boy may be studied. In the more respectable parts
of town, in the vicinity of schools and in the neighborhood
of churches may be seen evidences of what the youth of today
think play.</p>

<p>Time was when boys were content to play marbles. Some
of them, of course, had the temerity to play for keeps. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
were taught it was wicked, and even at the risk of being
called "sissy" refrained from disobeying their mothers. But
now marbles are a thing of the past. As soon as spring comes
boys want to shoot "craps." They want to play for money.
They want to gamble.</p>

<p>A visit to almost any school playground during recess or
the noon hour will convince any person that the modern boy
is a very wise youth. His conversation is not a well of English
pure and undefiled by any manner of means. In the first
place, his profanity is something shocking, and, in the next
place, his knowledge of the world and its wickedness is
thorough.</p>

<p>There is nothing the modern schoolboy does not know. He
is conversant with all sorts of vice and crime, even if he does
not take an actual part in it. If this sort of thing obtains
among schoolboys and youths of that class it is little wonder,
then, that the boys of the slums are what they are. And the
pictures is not overdrawn. The conversation of boys of ten
and a dozen years will bring the blush of shame even to a
grown man.</p>

<p>Just how to cure all this is a question that is bothering a
good many people. Societies are being organized right and
left. Homes for boys are being established, schools are being
started and other efforts are being made to reclaim the
delinquents. It has been found that good playgrounds in
the tenement districts have been beneficial. The boy is exuberant.
He must let out some of his animal spirits. If
he has a good place in which to play he will not be half as
apt to get into mischief.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Remedies Suggested by Some.</span></h3>

<p>There are some who insist that moral suasion should be
used at all times in an attempt to reform the juvenile. But
this has been found to fall short in many instances in Chicago.
Even the Juvenile Court, with all its benefits, is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to come somewhat short of doing everything for the vicious
lad. It is found that boys who are herded together in penal
institutions are inclined to leave such places much worse than
when they entered. The bad boys dominate. The evil spreads
and the good is suppressed. One bad boy is able to do much,
while the influence of one good boy amounts to almost nothing.</p>

<p>Those who have made a study of the matter aver that the
only true solution of the boy problem is individual work. The
lad's characteristics must be studied, the conditions under
which he has been living must be scrutinized and all the influences
that have been brought to bear upon his particular
case must be looked into. Under these circumstances it would
take a reformer for every dozen boys, and so far the money
has not been forthcoming to support so many reformers, for
even a reformer must live. A good many of the delinquent
youths of Chicago have been reared in squalid surroundings
and have been nurtured in filth and unloveliness. They have
been surrounded from babyhood by poverty, drunkenness and
depravity. These boys take to crime as naturally as a duck
does to water.</p>

<p>In order to reach boys and try to help them individually
a movement is now on foot to form juvenile protective leagues
in all parts of the city. One organization is now working in
the vicinity of Halsted and Twenty-second streets to put a
stop to race wars between school children. It is thought by
some that this new movement will fill a long-needed want. It
is admitted by those who have given the matter close study
that something must be done.</p>

<p>The records of the Juvenile Court and the books of the
John Worthy School emphatically bear out this contention.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Failure to Rule Children Makes Criminals.</span></h3>

<p>What are you doing with your child's sense of right and
wrong? Are you certain that you are not training a criminal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
beginning with him at two years old? What is your boy at six
years of age? Is he liar, thief&mdash;perhaps of insane ego as he
was when he first toddled from his mother's arms? Inferentially
President Roosevelt may have complimented you on the
acquisition of a large family, but rather than this, has it
occurred to you that the father and mother of one child, brought
up in the light of wisdom, may be deliverers of mankind
against the numerical inroads of the other type of parent?</p>

<p>Insanity is the mental condition out of which it is impossible
for the person of any age to recognize the rights of
others in any form. This insanity may be due wholly to the
overdevelopment of the primary ego in the child. At one year
old the infant may be a potential criminal of the worst type.
It lies to the mother by screaming as if in pain in order that
she may be brought to its bedside. If the adult should steal
personal property as this babe steals food wilfully, the penitentiary
would be his end. Angered, this same babe might attempt
murder in babyhood, the spirit fostered by the same
selfish intolerance that is filling jails and crowding gallows
traps.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Respect Rights of Others.</span></h3>

<p>Ego in the community life is the basis of all ill or all good,
even to the dream of Utopia. The basis of all ill is the primary
ego which is inseparable from the child until teaching
has eliminated it. The basis of all good is that secondary ego
which recognizes the rights of others.</p>

<p>Morality&mdash;good&mdash;virtue&mdash;all that is considered desirable in
the best type of citizenship develop out of the community life.
Even in the lower orders of animals a greater intelligence
marks the creatures that live community existences than is
to be seen in the isolated creatures. And this is from the
development of the secondary ego which exacts rights for
others.</p>

<p>The child has no knowledge of this secondary virtue save
as it is taught it. The mother who, by responding out of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
mistaken affection to every wail of the infant, encouraging
all, no longer is susceptible to home influences in teaching
the lesson. If this youth shall become entangled in the toils
of the law and the mistaken parents intercede for him, gaining
their ends in saving him from all punishment for his
misdeeds, the boy receives through it only another selfish impetus
toward more and greater offenses against society.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reformatory After First Crime.</span></h3>

<p>Here in this first offense of magnitude sufficient to call for
the intervention of the law the parents have their opportunity,
if only they would see. The place for such a youth at this
period is a reformatory in which are sufficient educational facilities
and the strictest discipline, which in justice visits the
full penalty of community transgressions upon the head of the
offender. In this reformatory environment the offending one
finds none of the intercessions that may have been made for
him in his home. In sterner fashion than he ever dreamed
before he discovers that as he transgresses the community laws
he receives a full penalty for the offense. Young enough, he
may be led to discover that his transgressions are not worth
while. Too old for these teachings, he becomes the persistent
lawbreaker, or, on the other hand, degenerates to the asylum
for the insane.</p>

<p>How intimately some of the fundamentals of training are
associated with everyday lives in the home, and yet not recognized,
is shown in the college life of the country. "Sophomore"
is a class term in schools which needs interpreting. As
a word, it is from the Greek, meaning "wise fool." Its application
in the higher education is to the second-year "men"&mdash;to
those students who are in that period of mental and physical
stress after the age of fifteen is reached. In school parlance
the word associates itself with the flamboyant youth who prates,
and preaches, and struts, and lays down the law of all things
as he sees it. Until twenty-five years old, indeed, the "Sophomoric"
period is not fully passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Broadly stated for all men, it may be reiterated that in the
parents' failure to enforce the subjection of the selfish first
nature in the child lies the seed of his destruction. Encouraging
the infant to wail again when nothing ails it is already
catering to this criminal ego. Later, when a parent humors
its every whim, he is stunting its growth toward good citizenship.
And later still, in that crisis in physical life, between
the ages of fifteen and twenty-five years, such a parent may
awaken suddenly to a realization of the criminal which he
has made.</p>

<p>Ego in the child mind prompts it to take instantly anything
which it desires and which it can take. Unchecked by training,
this primary ego grows with that upon which it feeds. At
two years old the child should have had its lessons in the rights
of others administered in any way in which it can be reached,
but always in all justice. Justice in this lesson should be the
first consideration. At six years of age these lessons are of
special significance. It is an age in the development of the
child when they may be taught with especial emphasis, with
lasting results.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Guide Child of Fifteen Carefully.</span></h3>

<p>At fifteen years old a new condition arises in the life of the
child. At this time the race condition and the individual condition
are at war. It is at the beginning of this period that
an unbridled, untrained youth may take his first step toward
crime, simply because the primary ego in him has not been
set toward the background by the lessons of his duty toward
the rights of others. Here it is that the heedless, ignorant
parents may come to the first realization of what his own sins
of omission have been.</p>

<p>If for any of the reasons suggested a youth's parents have
not given him this necessary training in recognition of the
rights of others, the age brings with it a condition making it
impossible in ordinary cases for the parental conscience and
home environment to avail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img078.jpg" width="600" height="437" alt="(DO IT NOW scenario)" />
</div>

<p>For example, the fact that the boy becomes a thief, or
burglar, indicates in any or many things that disregard for
the rights of others which is destructive to all law and order.
Properly handled in the home he would have been amenable
to all of these conditions.</p>

<p>Raise the child like a plant, care for it as you do for the
rarest specimen of vegetation, bring it up in an atmosphere
of love. Child raising and plant development are akin.</p>

<p>If the child has but the smallest trace of some characteristic
you desire to develop, take hold of it, care for it, surround
it with proper conditions and it will change more certainly
and readily than any plant quality.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Child Like a Plant.</span></h3>

<p>The child in nature and processes of growth is essentially
the same as the plant, only the child has a thousand strings
instead of but a few, as has the plant.</p>

<p>Where one can produce one change for the betterment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the plant one can produce a thousand changes for the betterment
of the child.</p>

<p>Surround the child with the proper environment to bring
out certain qualities and the result is inevitable.</p>

<p>Working in the same way as one does with the plant, the
development of the individual is practically unlimited.</p>

<p>Take the common daisy and train it and cultivate it by
proper selection and environment until it has been increased
in size, beauty and productiveness at least four hundred fold.</p>

<p>Do our educational methods do as much for our children?
If not, where is the weakness?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rear Child in Love.</span></h3>

<p>Have the child reared for the first ten years of its life in
the open, in close touch with nature, a barefoot boy with all
that implies for physical stamina, but have him reared in love.</p>

<p>Take the little yellow California poppy and by selecting
over and over again the qualities you wish to develop you
have brought forth an orange poppy, a crimson poppy, a blue
poppy. Cannot the same results be accomplished with the
human being? Is not the child as responsive?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Greatest Reform Movement of the Day Is the
Chicago Juvenile Court.</span></h3>

<p>The statistics show conclusively that the operation of the
Juvenile Court is an advance step in the treatment of the
young and helpless. It shows that not only are the dependents
helpless, but that the delinquents are helpless to extricate
themselves from a life of idleness and crime, for most criminals
are made, not born, and the sooner time is devoted to
changing the environments of the young, the sooner will be
solved the problem of criminology.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Illinois in the Lead.</span></h3>

<p>Various claims have been put forth from time to time as to
the State which was the first to inaugurate the Juvenile Court
idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>The Juvenile Court Law went into effect July 1, 1899, and
immediately the Juvenile Court was established. The Judges
of the Circuit Court assigned one of their members to preside
in the Juvenile Court.</p>

<p>The law gave the court jurisdiction of all dependent and
delinquent children who are under seventeen and eighteen years
of age, and defines dependents and delinquents. The word
"dependent" shall mean any child who for any reason is destitute
or homeless or abandoned, or dependent upon the public
for support, or has not proper parental care or guardianship,
or who habitually begs or receives alms, or who is found living
in any house of ill-fame or with any vicious or disreputable
persons, or whose home, by reason of neglect, cruelty or depravity
on the part of its parents, guardian or other persons
whose care it may be, is an unfit place for said child, and any
child under the age of ten years who is found begging, peddling
or selling any article, or singing or playing any musical instrument
upon the street, or giving any public entertainment,
or who accompanies or is used in aid of any person so
doing.</p>

<p>The word "delinquent" shall mean any boy under seventeen
or any girl under eighteen years of age who violates any law
of this State or any city or village ordinance, or who is incorrigible,
or who knowingly associates with thieves, vicious or
immoral persons, or who is growing up in idleness or crime, or
who knowingly frequents a house of ill-fame, or who knowingly
patronizes any policy shop or place where any gaming
device is or shall be operated.</p>

<p>A boy of seventeen is at a period of life where he is neither
a boy nor a man. In many cases he has the mind of the boy
and the impulses of the savage; his ideals are force, and his
ambitions that of the wild, erratic western rover. Why the
wise head and steady hand of the court and probation officer
should be withdrawn at this period is not explainable on any
reasonable theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be contended that a boy of seventeen years is too
advanced in the knowledge of crime, but it can also be contended
that the boy of fifteen years is too old in crime. Just
what standard can be used to find the responsibility of a boy
when measured by his age and physical proportions I am unable
to discover. The only just standard is mental capacity.
The Judge and probation officers, who are familiar with the
boy, know his parents or guardians and his environments,
should be allowed to exercise their judgment as to the moral
responsibility of the boy, for there are many boys at fifteen
who are more responsible for their acts than others at eighteen.</p>

<p>In many cases where children were committed to an institution
the parents were placed under the care of a probation
officer and the number of failures to reform the parent are
few.</p>

<p>In cases where the parents are responsible for the dependency
of existence those parents mean well, but they are unfitted
for the duties they have assumed. The father thinks he
has fulfilled his whole duty to his family when he provides
food, shelter and clothing; the mother thinks she has fulfilled
her whole duty when she does her house work and attends
to the mending and washing. The children are masters
of both parents before the parents take cognizance of the
actual mental state of the child.</p>

<p>What should be done when the boy's home is the case
of his delinquency is to provide for him a place where every
home impulse would be developed and where industry and
economy would be practiced. He should live in this home
under the jurisdiction of the court until he has reached his
eighteenth year.</p>

<p>What is said of the boys is equally true of the girls, and,
in many cases, more important. Where the father is directly
responsible for the downfall of the girl, the girl should not
be allowed to return to her parental home.</p>

<h2><a id="WILES_OF_FORTUNE_TELLING">WILES OF FORTUNE TELLING.</a></h2>

<h3>FORTUNE TELLERS HAVE EXISTED SINCE
RECORDS OF EVENTS BEGAN TO BE KEPT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Some of Their Methods&mdash;Charlatans Have a Great Hold
on the Poorer Classes of Big Cities, Much Alike&mdash;Schools
of Crime Run Full Blast&mdash;Silly and Ignorant
People Undone by Vicious and Wide-Open Fraud.</b></p>
</div>


<p>War against the swindlers, impostors and blackmailers who
operate in Chicago under the guise of clairvoyants, trance mediums,
astro-psychics, palmists, magicians and fortune tellers,
of whom there are about 1,500 in Chicago, should be driven
out of the city and never allowed to return.</p>

<p>There exist in Chicago a horde of these brazen frauds, who
ply their trade in the most open and unblushing manner. Few
of them are other than organized schools for the propagation
of crime, injustice and indecencies that would make an unjailed
denizen of the red light district blush to even mention.
We particularly refer to the army of fortune tellers, clairvoyants,
Hindoo fakers, mediums, palmists, hypnotists and other
skillful artists, whose sole occupation is to rob and mislead
the superstitious, foolish and ignorant. The business is a paying
industry, realizing, it is said, an enormous sum of money
every month in Chicago, all of which is obtained by false pretenses.</p>

<p>Here is a very large field for police investigation. The practices
of these people are of the most demoralizing tendency.
Can there be anything worse than holding out love potions to
married women to compel other women's husbands to love them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Those dens of iniquity offer their services and even actually aid
in the procuring of abortions, and in showing how and where
a good haul can be made by robbery or burglary. They bring
together the depraved of both sexes. Many of them are purveyors
to our brothels and stews.</p>

<p>They flaunt their profession, their "spiritual mysteries,"
brazenly in public in our busy thoroughfares, even invading
some of our hotels. They are the hotbeds of vice and crime,
from the robbing of orphans to the deflowering of innocent
girls. They fall into "trances" and call up spirits from the
vaults of heaven, or elsewhere, to testify to their truth, and in
the turn-up of an ace of spades they see a "dark lady" or a
"dark gentleman" who is pining for you, and furnish the address
of either.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Panderers to Depravity.</span></h4>

<p>Why these panderers to depravity in all its most hideous
forms are permitted to continue their depredations among
every rank of society without attracting the attention of "reformers"
or the grand jury is something beyond the ken of
human knowledge. And as a block is a small cityful in some
parts of the town, the reading of palms, the casting of horoscopes
and the looking into seeds of time through the backs
of a greasy pack of thumb-marked, tear-stained cards is a
profitable calling. Perhaps it should be explained that the
tears are not shed by the prophets of the tenements, but by
the patrons who go to the oracle to learn if they are to be
dispossessed next month or if their ambitious children will
sometime learn a little Yiddish, so that they may talk with their
own parents in their own homes, are sources of information
for the settlement workers and others who try to learn the
hopes and fears and ambitions, the real life of such places.
But the fortune tellers are the real custodians of the Ghetto's
secrets. In their little back rooms, some of which are cluttered
with the trash that suggests the occult to the believer, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
as bare as the room of a lodger who has pawned the last stick
of furniture, they hear confessions that court interpreters never
have a chance to translate, and listen to tales of hard luck that
are never told to the rabbis.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Prognostications Are Vague.</span></h4>

<p>But they don't use the mails to drum up trade, and they
have no barkers at the doorsteps to cajole the credulous to step
inside to learn what the future has in store for them. And
so, in a legal sense, they are guilty of no fraud. They are not
very serious frauds in any sense, for their tricks are harmless
and their prognostications are vague as the weather predictions
of an almanac and as probable as the sayings of the cart-tail
orators who hold forth at the street corners in campaign
time.</p>

<p>"About this time, look for cold winds, with some snow,"
sagely remarks the almanac writer, stringing the ten words
of his prediction down the entire column of the month.</p>

<p>"In a few years," says the fortune teller, solemnly, "you will
have good friends and more money than you have now."</p>

<p>"If you vote for this man," shrieks the cart-tail orator,
"rents will be lower and the street cleaner and you will get
jobs. The other ticket stands for graft and greed. Vote for
it if you want your children to run in the streets, because
there is no room for them in the schools."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Predicts Like a Spellbinder.</span></h4>

<p>Like the spellbinder, the oracle frequently builds on the look-on-this-picture-and-then-on-that
plan.</p>

<p>"This is a strong line," mumbles the palmist. "You will
meet a man with blue eyes who will help you, but beware of
a man with dark hair."</p>

<p>Sometimes the helper has light hair and the man to be
avoided black eyes. But invariably the good friend of the
future is blond and the devil is brunette. No seer would any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
more think of changing that color scheme than the writer of
a melodrama would dare stage a villain who didn't have hair
and mustache as black as night. That prediction is one of
the traditions of the art, and no future has ever been complete
without the dark and the light men or the dark and
the light woman, as the case might be.</p>

<p>One of the most famous of fortune tellers, a woman, died
suddenly. She had been reading cards in the same house for
forty years, and on the day of her funeral her house was
crowded with mourners, whose future she had foreseen with
so much shrewdness that not one of the 200 or more men and
women who filed by the coffin, to view the body had any fault
to find with the services she had rendered. On the contrary,
they compared notes, each trying to pay the best tribute to
the dead by telling the most wonderful story of her predictions.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Warned of the Enemy.</span></h4>

<p>"I was sitting right in this room at that table where the
flowers are today," said one mourner, "and she said to me:
'You have an enemy. It is here on this card where you can
see it plainly. But here is a friend, a tall, light man, who
will come between you and your enemy. Put your trust in the
tall, light man, but keep away from a dark man. There is a
dark-haired woman who pretends to be your friend, but lies
about you.'"</p>

<p>Compare that prediction of the oracle with this forecast of
Daniel Defoe's famous deaf and dumb predictor, Duncan
Campbell.</p>

<p>"To Mme. S&mdash;&mdash;h W&mdash;&mdash;d; I see but one misfortune after
the year of 1725. A black man, pretty tall and fat, seems
to wish you no good. Never tell your secrets to any such
persons, and their malice cannot hurt you."</p>

<p>And that warning wasn't original when Mme. S&mdash;&mdash;h
W&mdash;&mdash;d called at Duncan Campbell's lodging in London to
learn what was what. No doubt it could be traced beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Delphi. That's almost as safe a guess as to assume that Mme.
S&mdash;&mdash;h W&mdash;&mdash;d was a Sarah Wood. She might have been a
Wedd or a Weld, but that is doubtful.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Predictions Change Little.</span></h4>

<p>So, although the seer of Randolph street and all the rest
probably never heard of Duncan Campbell or Nostradamus, or
of their predecessors at Delphi, they have kept the profession
of forecasting remarkably free of innovations.</p>

<p>"This art of prediction," reads Defoe's Life and Adventures
of Duncan Campbell, "is not attainable any otherwise than
by these three ways. 1. It is done by the company of familiar
spirits and genii, which are of two sorts (some good and
some bad), who tell the gifted person the things, of which he
informs other people. 2. It is performed by the second sight,
which is very various and differs in most of the possessors, it
being only a very little in some, very extensive and constant in
others; beginning with some in their infancy and leaving them
before they come to years, happening to others in a middle
age, to others again in an old age that never had it before,
and lasting only for a term of years, and now and then for a
very short period of time; and in some intermitting, like fits,
as it were, of vision that leave them for a time, and then return
to be strong in them as ever; and it being in a manner hereditary
in some families, whose children have it from their infancy
(without intermission) to a great old age, and even to
the time of their death, which they even foretell before it
comes to pass, to a day&mdash;nay, even to an hour. 3. It is attained
by the diligent study of the lawful part of the art of
magic."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Make Enough to Retire.</span></h4>

<p>Nowadays the prophets see to it that their miraculous power
does not depart from them for any cause whatsoever until
their own palms have been crossed with enough silver to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
them to retire in comfort. A certain Fatima who told
fortunes on Madison street for years removed her card from
the front window and disappeared altogether. She had bought
a farm up the state, where she is now living and raising
fancy breeds of poultry. There is no mortgage on the farm,
and the hens have grain three times a day.</p>

<p>Just which one of Duncan Campbell's three methods a certain
practitioner uses is not apparent, but he was one of the
most noted and successful fortune tellers, and his men patrons
set more store by what he said than in the promises of the
district leaders.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Answers Questions for a Dollar.</span></h4>

<p>He has reduced his business to a fine system, and all the
questions that anybody could possibly think of are set down
in a book with numbers opposite them. And these books,
printed in Yiddish, English and German, anticipate all the
hopes and fears of the tenements. The questions, all of a
strong local flavor, are all answered by the fortune teller off-hand
for $1, notwithstanding the fact that they present some
of the toughest problems that the philanthropists who support
the Educational Alliance and the settlement houses have been
trying for years to solve. To illustrate, take this group of
questions under the general classifications "Home and Children":</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">"Can I learn English?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Can I make my son or daughter learn Yiddish?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall my children play with Christians?"</li>
</ul>

<p>The book printed in Yiddish shows the most wear. It is
divided under these heads: "Travel and Letters," "Love and
Marriage," "Home and Children," "Business," "Work," "Luck
and Losses."</p>

<p>Some of the questions make interesting reading and supplementary
to the reports and papers of the various Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
charity organizations. One of the more recent of these reports
gave statistics of desertions of wives, and "other women" was
put down as the cause in a large number of cases.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Married Two Wives; What Will Happen?</span></h4>

<p>The first question in the fortune tellers book under "Travel
and Letters" is, "Where did my husband elope to?" The identity
of the other woman in the case seems to be secondary in
importance to the whereabouts of the deserter.</p>

<p>Under "Love and Marriage" are these questions, among
many others:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">"Is my bride's dowry as big as she says it is?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"I have married two wives; what will happen?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I be married in court?"</li>
</ul>


<p>Those who are in doubt about work have many questions
to select from, the list starting off like this:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">"Shall I be a letter carrier?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I be a conductor?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I be a street cleaner?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I be an actor?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I be a lady-figure?"</li>
</ul>

<p>A lady-figure is undoubtedly a cloak model.</p>


<p>Under "Business" some of the questions are:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">"Shall I remain a peddler or keep a store?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I sue my partner?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Will my partner sue me?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I take my wife into the store as a partner?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I take my husband into the store as a partner?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Shall I buy the goods?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Will the bank fail?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Under "Luck and Losses" are:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">"Was I robbed by friends or strangers?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Does anybody look in my pockets nights?"</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Will the landlord put me out?"</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Roomful of Patrons.</span></h4>

<p>The deviser of these books keeps his office in a rear tenement
open from early morning till late at night, and there is generally
a roomful of anxious patrons awaiting their turns.</p>

<p>At a single sitting, price $1, the man or woman who wants
to know may select three questions. She puts the number
corresponding to the questions on a slip of paper. The numbers
do not run in regular order through the book or through
any section of it.</p>

<p>The slip of paper is kept concealed by the questioner, and
later on, when she is in the actual presence of the oracle, she
writes those numbers again on another slip of paper, hidden
from the fortune teller by a book cover. She also writes her
name on two pieces of paper, which she places in two Bibles,
opened at random by the fortune teller after she has named
any three words she happens to see on the page.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Gets Pointers from Customer.</span></h4>

<p>Then the books are closed, the soothsayer tells his customer
what her name is (he is not often absolutely accurate in that
part of the game), and then he begins to talk about the past
and future in such a rambling, comprehensive way that he
is almost sure to hit upon, directly or indirectly, the questions
she has in mind. If he is too far off the trail he asks the
woman from time to time if she understands him, and from
her replies and questions gets a further clew as to just which
three questions she had selected from the lists. Then the rest
is simple.</p>

</div>

<p>September 2, 1906, Catherine Nichols, Sarah Nichols and
Jennie Nichols, 186 Sebor street, fake exponents of materialization
of spirits and general "spook" grafters, were arrested,
the seances raided and the game closed, by Detectives Wooldridge
and Barry.</p>

<p>The scene of the raid was a brick building at 184 Sebor
street, which is just east of Halsted and a block south of Harrison
street.</p>

<p>The medium arrested was Miss Jennie Nichols, who, with
her mother, Mrs. Catherine Nichols, and her sister, Sarah, had
been gleaning a harvest of dollars from guillible residents,
mostly of the West Side of the city, during the last two years.
The establishment of the Nichols family occupies parts of two
buildings, the mother and her two daughters living at 186
Sebor street, next door to 184. On the second floor of the latter
address was located the hall which they used for their public
seances.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Plans Are Well Laid.</span></h4>

<p>The raid was made on the authority of a warrant which was
applied for by Miss Muriel Miller, a young woman who was
induced by the blandishments of other mediums to come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Chicago from her home in Portland, Ore. Miss Miller, who is
employed in a barber shop in Clark street, is slightly deaf. She
became interested in Spiritualism, and thus came in touch with
the Nichols' outfit.</p>

<span class="smcap">CATHERINE Nichols</span>, <span class="smcap">JENNIE Nichols</span></div>
</div>

<p>She had written to another Chicago medium, and received
letters in answer signed "Professor Venazo."</p>

<p>It was explained to Miss Miller that the wonderful cures
which the medium professed to be able to make were brought
about while the patient was in a trance. In a letter which had
been turned over to the police, "Professor Venazo," which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the name with which an accomplice of certain Chicago mediums
signed such communications, explained that because of stress
of business it would be impossible to undertake to cure Miss
Miller of her deafness unless she was prepared to put up at
least $50 in cash.</p>

<p>The letter stated that if she would send to "Professor
Venazo" $100 the medium would undertake to go to her home
and cure her there. If she did not wish to pay that much money
she could come to Chicago, pay the medium $50, and be cured
"while in a trance."</p>

<p>Detectives Barry and David Carroll were detailed to assist
Wooldridge in serving the warrants and making the raid.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Detectives Attend Service.</span></h4>

<p>Barry and Carroll planned to effect an entrance to the
"seance." Inspector Revere was informed and asked to give
a detail of six officers, who, headed by Detective Wooldridge,
went to the hall on Sebor street. Barry and Carroll had preceded
them and succeeded in convincing Jennie Nichols, who
was the master of ceremonies, that they were interested in
spiritualism and desired to witness the materializations.</p>

<p>When they went to the hall, Detective Barry walked in and
found twenty-eight or thirty others there before him. Jennie
Nichols was busy arranging the spectators in seats. She took
a great deal of care about placing them. Carroll and Barry
entered and signed their names on the register. This was a
book in which everyone who is admitted to a seance is requested
to place his name and place of residence. Barry signed
as "John Woods"; address, 142 Ashland boulevard.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calling Up the Spirits.</span></h4>

<p>When the seance opened Jennie Nichols conducted those
who were in the hall through the main room and the one at
the rear, before which the curtain was placed. Everything
was all right, so far as Detectives Barry and Carroll could see.
The cabinet from which the spirits were to come stood across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
one corner, and opposite it was a door leading into one of the
two rooms in the rear of the hall.</p>

<p>They examined the cabinet and the rooms carefully, but
found everything all right. After they had been through everything
the doors were locked and they returned to their seats,
Miss Nichols making some other changes in the arrangements
of the seats, and then the place was darkened.</p>

<p>When the place had been made almost entirely dark, Jennie
Nichols, the medium, began pacing back and forth in front of
the curtain. She rubbed her hands over her head and eyes a
number of times, and began to chant: "Come, O queen, O
queen."</p>

<p>When she began to call on the "queen" the spectators began
to get excited. Most of them appeared to be thoroughly familiar
with the proceedings, and several of them said: "Oh,
I hope it's the king."</p>

<p>Then the medium pulled a cord which was attached to a light
enclosed in a sheet-iron case, the one small opening of which
was covered with several thicknesses of green tissue paper.
When she pulled the string the room became darker than ever.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Spirits Begin to Move.</span></h4>

<p>Before she began her incantations the medium had requested
everyone present not to cross their feet, and to try to assist
her to bring the spirits before them. She said that it would
probably not be possible to bring a spirit for everybody, but
that if all helped her, the spirits wanted by many in the audience
would surely appear.</p>

<p>Then she asked them all to sing "Nearer, My God, to Thee,"
which they did, and after a few more passes over her temples
and in front of her eyes the spirit began to move. The detectives
could see it, and they began to think they had been
wrong in thinking there was nothing in spiritualism. It certainly
appeared real. First one form would glide back and
forth in front of the curtain, then an entirely different one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
would appear. Altogether there were spirits of about ten men
and children materialized.</p>

<p>As the apparitions moved slowly in front of the curtain, in
the spectral light which made it impossible to detect more than
a faint outline of the form, women rushed forward crying out
that it was their husband, or their child, that they saw. They
stretched out their hands to clasp the forms of their departed,
but Jennie Nichols and her male assistant would take them by
their hands and tell them they must not touch the spirit or
it would fade away. You could get within six inches of the
figures, and peer into the faces as they passed to and fro, but
everyone was restrained from attempting to touch them. In
the ghostly light of the room the closest inspection could not
determine that the figures were frauds, so clever were they disguised.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Keys Up the Spectators.</span></h4>

<p>While the detectives were waiting for the materialization, a
woman they knew entered the room. Barry put his handkerchief
up to his face for fear she would recognize him. They
wanted to know what was the matter with him, and Barry said
that he guessed he had something in his eye. They wanted to
take it out, and he had to put his handkerchief away. He
thought he was discovered, but the woman, Mrs. Ella Hoobler,
319 West Madison street, said nothing about him. After they
had arrested the Nichols woman, Mrs. Hoobler told Barry she
had recognized him when she first entered the room, but she
thought he was "bug" in the game, and said nothing.</p>

<p>After about ten materializations of husbands and children
had keyed the spectators up to a high pitch, Mrs. Hoobler asked
for the spirit of her daughter, Helen. In a few minutes the
figure of a young girl, clad in white from head to foot, appeared
before the curtain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Helen, my Helen!" Mrs. Hoobler exclaimed, rushing
to the apparition. "Oh, mamma!" came the answer in a shrill
falsetto voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">

<div class="caption">Medium's Paraphernalia Seized by Police in Raid.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Jennie Nichols and the big assistant seized Mrs. Hoobler's
hands just as she was about to clasp what she believed to be
the spirit of her daughter in her arms.</p>

<p>"You must not touch it," Jennie Nichols told her, "or the
spirit will go away."</p>

<p>The poor, almost frantic woman kneeled before the apparition.
Barry thought it was time to get busy, and he whispered
softly to Carroll: "Watch out, there's going to be a pinch."
Then he threw on the flashlight and whistled for the squad
outside to come in.</p>

<p>Just as he did this the "spook" in front of him looked so
realistic that for the life of him he couldn't decide whether
he was going up against a real spirit or not. But he took a
chance and grabbed for it. Even when he had hold of it and
knew it must be flesh and blood, it seemed so slimy, with the
white stuff rubbed over it, that he felt his hair rising.</p>

<p>Just about that time the medium outfit got busy. The big
man who had been helping Jennie Nichols hold the hands of the
people who were trying to grab the spirits of their dead hit
Barry over the head with some sort of a club that knocked him
to the floor. Jennie Nichols put out the light entirely, grabbed
Barry's flashlight and began pounding him over the head with
it. They went to the floor in a rough and tumble scrimmage,
the crowd on top of them, yelling and screaming.</p>

<p>In the next room Carroll was busy, too. He got hold of Mrs.
Catherine Nichols, the mother, who had been helping with the
show, and he was beset by spectators who were incensed because
the seance had been broken up.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Wooldridge Takes a Hand.</span></h4>

<p>When Detective Wooldridge and his detail broke down the
doors of the hall and made their entrance into the place it was
pitch dark, and they had to strike matches before they could
separate the combatants.</p>

<p>After a semblance of order had been restored in the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the premises were searched, and a most astounding outfit of
disguises discovered. Before this development the spectators,
who had been held in the place, were very angry with the
officers, saying that they had been attending the seances for
the last two years; that they knew Jennie Nichols as a medium
had shown them the spirits of their dead. When the officers
produced Sarah Nichols, to whom Detective Barry had held
when he seized the "spook," they discovered that she had been
wearing a pair of sandal slippers with felt five inches thick
for soles; a pair of men's black trousers and the white shroud
and painted picture face of a young girl.</p>

<p>Attached to a pole in front of her was a paper head, around
which was a white shroud four feet in length. Those in attendance
believed this image to be the spirit of a believer's dead
relative. The "medium" had "spook" images of men, women
and children, and could produce them as circumstances demanded.
The light was turned up, and the contemptible imposition
on credulity was exposed to twenty-six dupes, who had
been paying $1 apiece for the privilege of attending meetings
of the "spook" grafters for years. It was the greatest exposé
of "spooks" that has been made in many years. A wagon load
of masks, wigs, false whiskers, tin horns, gowns with safety
pins in them, skulls and skeletons with cross-bones to match,
were seized.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Women Refuse to Talk.</span></h4>

<p>At the station the women refused to talk. Sarah Nichols,
the "spook," had donned a house dress before she was taken
to the station. Jennie Nichols, the "medium," was dressed in
a neat black gown of rich material. The mother appeared
in a black skirt and a white shirtwaist. The latter is a gray-haired
woman apparently about 50 years old. She wept copiously.
Sarah Nichols also wept. In the scrimmage after the
arrest her ear had been injured, and it was bleeding when the
trio was booked at the station.</p>

<p>Jennie Nichols was the most composed of all. She held a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
palm leaf fan in front of her face and above it twinkled a pair
of shrewd blue eyes. As she and her relatives were led from
the private room at Harrison street she even laughed, although
her mother and her sister were in tears, and her victims were
denouncing her for having robbed them, through their credulity,
of hundreds of dollars, which many of them could ill afford
to lose.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Wooldridge Makes Ghost Walk in Police Court.</span></h4>

<p>A "spook" sat on the bench with Justice Prindiville. He
made ghosts walk and graveyards yawn.</p>

<p>The "spook" was Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge.</p>

<p>When Miss Sarah Nichols, "the ghost," Miss Jennie Nichols,
"the trance medium," and Mrs. Catherine Nichols, mother
of the other two known as the "overseer," appeared in court to
answer to charges of obtaining money by false pretenses through
spiritualistic seances, Detective Wooldridge crowded to the
center of the stage.</p>

<p>He bore a great board, on which were tacked white shrouds,
grinning skulls and cross-bones, the costume of an Indian, and
other instruments of the medium's trade.</p>

<p>"For the benefit of the public at large," he said, addressing
the court, "I ask permission to expose the methods of these
fake spiritualists."</p>

<p>The permission was given, and "Spook" Wooldridge took
the wool sack.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">"Spook" Wooldridge Demonstrates.</span></h4>

<p>He lit the punk with which the mediums were wont to light
up the skull. He burned incense. He put on a white gown.</p>

<p>"This is Carrie's garment," he said, pointing to where "Ghost"
Carrie, twenty-four years old and buxom, stood.</p>

<p>He went through the whole performance, save the grease
paint. He started to daub his face with the stuff, which gave a
ghostly hue, when the justice interrupted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"You needn't dirty your face, Friend Spook. You've scored
your points already." The "Spook" had, indeed.</p>

<p>Despite the exposures, many women and a few men who
had come to hear the cases, expressed their devotion to the
persons arrested and to the "cause."</p>

<p>They finally became so demonstrative that Justice Prindiville
ordered the court room cleared of the "devotees."</p>

<p>"This is not a matinee, a spiritualists' meeting or a circus,"
said the Justice. "Let the devotees meet in the outer hall."</p>

<p>Fifty women, of all ages and many conditions of life, stood
with mouths wide open and eyes bulging as Wooldridge went
through his performance. They were the victims of the Nichols
women.</p>

<p>Jennie Nichols and Sarah Nichols were fined $100 each.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Arrest South Side Mediums.</span></h4>

<p>To conclude the record of the day, Detectives Wooldridge
and Barry, accompanied by two officers from the Cottage Grove
station, visited a seance given by Clarence A. Beverly and Mrs.
M. Dixon at Arlington hall, Thirty-first street and Indiana
avenue. The officers bought tickets and awaited the performance.
After a lecture on psychic problems by "Dr." Beverly
and a programme of music rendered by children, "Dr." Dixon
took the rostrum and went through a series of clairvoyant discoveries.</p>

<p>Among the things which she professed to predict while in
her "trance" was a prognostication which had not a little to do
with the developments of the evening. After she had pointed
out a number of persons in the audience and told what they
had done or should do, she discovered Wooldridge and singled
him out.</p>

<p>"I see a man with glasses who has his hands crossed over
his knees," she said. "I am governed by the spirit of John
Googan, an Irishman. He gives you a message," pointing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Wooldridge, "and says that whatever John orders must be
done."</p>

<p>At this Wooldridge, arising from his seat, advanced to the
rostrum.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Officer Serves Papers.</span></h4>

<p>"John Collins, chief of police, says, Mrs. Dixon, that I am
to put you under arrest under a state warrant charging you
with receiving money by a confidence game. I also have a
warrant charging the same offense against Clarence A. Beverly.
Dr. Beverly, please come forth."</p>

<p>Dr. Beverly presented himself, and both he and Mrs. Dixon
were taken to Harrison street, where strenuous efforts on their
behalf on the part of "Dr." Harry H. Tobias, spiritual mental
healer, with offices at 118 East Thirty-third street, and others,
failed to procure them bonds.</p>

<p>The arrest of Beverly and Mrs. Dixon was made on a warrant
signed by Miss Miller, who had entered into correspondence
with them from her home in Portland, Ore. The fee in Chicago
was to have been $50, according to the letters she received
from the mediums, as in the preceding instance. She borrowed
money to come to Chicago, and had but $25 to pay the "healers."
When she received no benefit from their treatment she made
complaint and was threatened with violence, she alleges. Thereupon
she laid her case before Chief Collins, resulting in the
raid and the closing up of this place.</p>

<p>Thus did the sleuth a-sleuthing vanquish the ubiquitous
"spook," the "ghost," the "spirit," the re-incarnation, the Mahatma,
the "sending," and all the hosts of the immaterial
world, whose immaterialism was being converted into good hard
material cash by the producers of the evanescent shapes from
beyond the veil.</p>

<p>Thus did Clifton R. Wooldridge and his able assistants make
"spooking" a dangerous business in Chicago.</p>

<h2><a id="WIFE_OR_GALLOWS">WIFE OR GALLOWS?</a><br />

<small>PREFERS HANGING TO LIVING WITH HIS WIFE.</small></h2>


<p>Hugo Devel prefers being hanged to living with his wife.</p>

<p>Unable to escape her in any other way, lacking the courage
or nerve to kill himself, and shuddering at the idea of life
imprisonment with the woman he had promised to love and
cherish, he confessed to a murder he did not commit, and
was ready to go upon the gallows or to penal servitude for life
in the stead of the real murderer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img085.jpg" width="600" height="388" alt="He'd rather be hanged than live with his wife." />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">He'd rather be hanged than live with his wife.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Now he is free, and miserable, and in his home at Lubeck,
in Germany. He is envying Franz Holz, who is awaiting the
gallows.</p>

<p>Devel admits sadly that he had a double purpose in wanting
to die on the gallows. First, that he would escape his wife;
and, second, that, by being hanged he would make it improbable
that any other man should meet his fate&mdash;not his fate
on the gallows, but his fate in having wedded Frau Devel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>The case, which was cleared up by the Hamburg police, furnished
a problem that would have defied the cunning of Sherlock
Holmes and all his kindred analysts. Briefly stated, the
facts in the case, which is the strangest one ever given to a
detective department to solve, are these:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Woman Was Robbed and Murdered.</span></h3>

<p>A few months ago a certain Frau Gimble, of Munich, was
cruelly murdered by a man. The evident motive of the deed
was robbery, and that the crime was planned and premeditated
there was sufficient evidence. Every clew and circumstance
pointed to Franz Holz. He was known to have been at
or near the scene of the murder shortly before its commission.
He knew the woman, and had knowledge that she kept a considerable
sum of money in her home. He was known to have
been without money for days prior to the murder, and immediately
after the deed, and before the body was discovered, he
had appeared with a quantity of money, made some purchases,
bought drinks for acquaintances, and then disappeared.</p>

<p>The police were on his trail within a short time after the
finding of the body of the murdered woman. Holz had fled
toward Berlin, and a warning was sent in all directions, containing
descriptions of the fugitive.</p>

<p>The awfulness of the deed attracted the more attention because
of the locality and the ruthless and cruel manner of its
commission. While the police were making a rapid search for
the fugitive Holz, Hugo Devel, a well-to-do tradesman in
Lubeck, surrendered himself to the police of his home town and
confessed that he, and not Holz, had committed the crime.
Devel had been in Hamburg at the time the crime was committed.
His confession, which destroyed all the evidence and
all the theories implicating Holz, staggered the detectives.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devel Confesses to the Crime.</span></h3>

<p>Although apparently saved from a remarkable network of
circumstantial evidence, and no longer wanted for the murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
of the Gimble woman, the German police reasoned that Holz,
if he had not fled because of that crime, must have fled because
of some other crime. So the department, which has a
name a couple of feet long, which in English would mean,
"the department for finding out everything about everybody,"
kept on the trail.</p>

<p>Meantime the police of Hamburg got possession of Devel
and examined him. From the first they were uneasy. He confessed
that he murdered the woman to get her money, and beyond
that would not tell anything. It is not customary for
the police to insist that a man who confesses that he is guilty
of murder shall prove it, but there were facts known to the
police which made them wonder how it was possible for Devel
to have killed the woman. They used the common police
methods, and made the prisoner talk. The more he talked
the more apparent it became to the police that he was innocent,
although he still claimed vehemently that he, and he
alone, killed the Gimble woman.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Police Learn He is Not Guilty.</span></h3>

<p>Some of his statements were ridiculous. For instance, he
did not know what quarter of the city the woman lived in. He
did not know how she had been murdered. He said he climbed
through a window and killed the woman. When pressed, he
said the window was the dining-room window. In view of the
fact that she was killed while working in a little open, outdoor
kitchen when murdered, the police became satisfied that Devel
was not the man, and ordered the pursuit of Holz resumed by
all departments.</p>

<p>The case even then was a remarkable one, and one which
would have defied any theoretical detective. The police proved
that it was impossible that Devel should be confessing in order
to shield Holz&mdash;first, because he never knew Holz; and second,
because the police had informed him that the real murderer
was in custody, in order to discover a reason for his confession.
It was suspected that Devel was partly insane and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
seeking notoriety. Everything in his life refuted that idea.
He was a quiet, orderly citizen, who seldom read newspapers,
and who neither was interested in crime or criminals. He
owned a small business in Lubeck, attended to it strictly, drank
little, and apparently was as sane as any one.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Searching for Motive of Confession.</span></h3>

<p>The case worried the police officials. The absolute lack of
reason for Devel's confession stimulated their curiosity. He
was held in custody for weeks, and then the police gave up in
despair, and, as Holz had been arrested and had confessed to
everything, the release of Devel was ordered. The order of
release proved the move that revealed the truth. When he was
told that he was free to return home, Devel broke down and
begged the police to keep him in prison, to hang him, to poison
him, but not to send him home.</p>

<p>In his agony he confessed that the only reason he confessed
the murder was that he desired to get hanged, and that he
preferred hanging to life with his wife.</p>

<p>The hard-hearted police set him free&mdash;literally threw him
out of the prison, and he returned to his wife in Lubeck. The
following day he resumed charge of his business.</p>

<p>An English correspondent visited Devel in his shop and made
certain inquiries of him regarding the case. As the hanging
editor would say, "the condemned man was nervous." He was
afraid his wife would read what he said, but the correspondent
finally got him to tell.</p>

<p>"I desired to be hung," said Devel, mournfully. "Life is
not worth the living, and with my wife it is worse than death.
If I had been hanged no other man would marry my wife, and
I would save them from my fate. Many times have I planned
to kill myself to escape her. That is sin, and I lack the bravery
to kill myself, besides. If they will not hang me I must
continue to live with my wife."</p>

<p>Devel states, among other things, that these are the chief
grievances against married life in general, and his wife in
particular:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">She was slender, and became fat and strong.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She was beautiful, and became ugly and coarse.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She was tender, and grew hard.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She was loving, and grew virulent.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She grew whiskers on her chin.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She called him "pig."</li>

<li class="ifrst">She wore untidy clothes, and her hair was unkempt.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She refused to give him beer.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Her breath smelled of onions and of garlic.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She threw hot soup upon him.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She continually upbraided him because there were no children.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She scolded him in the presence of neighbors.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She refused to permit him to bring his friends home.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She came into his store and scolded him.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She accused him of infidelity.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She disturbed him when he slept in the garden on Sundays.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She made him cook his own dinners.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She spilled his beer when he drank quietly with friends.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She told tales about him among the neighbors, and injured
his business.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She served his sausages and his soup cold, and sometimes
did not have his meals for him when he came home.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She did not make the beds nor clean the house.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She took cards out of his skat deck.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She talked continually, and scolded him for everything or
nothing.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She opened the windows when he closed them, and closed
them when he opened them.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She poured water into his shoes while he slept.</li>

<li class="ifrst">She cut off his dachshund's tail.</li>
</ul>


<p>These things, he said, made him prefer to be hanged to
living with her.</p>

<p>Incidentally Holz, who is awaiting execution, expresses an
earnest desire to trade places with Herr Devel.</p>

<p>There is no accounting for tastes.</p>

<h2><a id="A_CLEVER_SHOPLIFTER">A CLEVER SHOPLIFTER.</a><br />

<small>DETECTIVE WOOLDRIDGE FINDS A FAIR
CRIMINAL.</small></h2>


<p>While passing through the Fair, one of the largest retail
dry goods establishments in Chicago, Detective Wooldridge
noticed one of the cleverest shoplifters that ever operated in
Chicago, Bertha Lebecke, known as "Fainting Bertha."</p>

<p>She was standing in front of the handkerchief counter,
where her actions attracted Wooldridge's attention, and he
concluded to watch her. She called the girl's attention to
something on the shelf and as she turned to get it Bertha's
hand reached out and took a half dozen expensive lace handkerchiefs,
which disappeared in the folds of her skirt.</p>

<p>The act was performed so quickly and with such cleverness
that it would have gone unnoticed unless one were looking right
at her and saw her take the handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>From the handkerchief counter she went to the drug department,
where she secured several bottles of perfume. As
she was leaving this counter she met a Central detective who
had arrested her before for the same offense. He stopped a
few yards from her to make some trifling purchases. She,
thinking he was watching her, left the store.</p>

<p>From the Fair she went to Siegel-Cooper's, another large
dry goods store several blocks away. Detective Wooldridge followed
her. She was seen to go from counter to counter, and
from each one she succeeded in getting some article.</p>

<p>As she was leaving the store she was placed under arrest
by Detective Wooldridge and taken to the Police Station.</p>

<p>When she was arrested she fainted, and a great crowd gathered
around her, and many of the women cried and implored
Detective Wooldridge not to arrest her, but he would not be
moved by any of them to let her go free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>When she arrived at the Police Station she was searched, and
beneath the folds of her skirt was found a strong waist pocket
which looked like a petticoat. It consisted of two pieces of
material gathered full at the top with a strong cord or puckering
string run through, and sewed together around the edges.
In front of this great bag was a slit two feet long opening from
the top to within a few inches of the bottom. This petticoat was
worn under the dress skirt. On each side of the outside skirt
was a long slit concealed by the folds of the skirt, and with
one hand she could slip the stolen articles in through the slit
in the inside of her dress and into the petticoat bag to the
opening in front. The capacity of the bag was enormous. She
had stolen some $40 or $50 worth of goods when arrested. The
following morning she was arraigned in the Police Court and
heavily fined, and the goods were restored to the merchants.</p>

<p>Bertha Lebecke, 27 years old, is conceded by Illinois state
authorities to be the most troublesome person who ever crossed
the state line from any direction at any time.</p>

<p>Just how large a cash bonus the state treasury today might
be willing to advance could it be assured of Bertha's deportation
forever beyond the confines of Illinois is something difficult
to estimate, but it is certain that in the asylums for the
insane at Kankakee, Elgin and Bartonville, and in the state
penitentiary at Joliet there are attendants on salaries who
would make personal contributions to help swell the possible
fund.</p>

<p>Yet "Fainting Bertha" Lebecke is one of the prettiest,
blondest, most delicate handed little bits of well-developed
femininity that ever made a marked success in deceiving people
of both sexes and all conditions in public, afterwards deceiving
officials of jails, asylums and penitentiaries until bars and
gates and frowning walls were as cobwebs before her.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sleeps All Day; Makes Night Hideous.</span></h3>

<p>Gates of steel never have held her in jail or asylum. In
the mightier penitentiaries she has made herself such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> uncontrolled
fury by night&mdash;sleeping calmly all day long and
resting for the next seance&mdash;that penitentiary gates have
opened for her in the hope of having her maintained as an
asylum ward. After which "Fainting Bertha" has secured keys
to asylum doors and gone her untrammeled way straight back
to a police record which for years has shown her to be one of
the most remarkable pickpockets, diamond snatchers and shoplifters
of her time.</p>

<p>Making such a nuisance of herself in the penitentiary as no
longer to be tolerated in a refined convict community, she
proves her madness. In the locked, barred, asylum she proves
her cunning at escape. And, once more at liberty, the abandon
with which she goes after personal property in any form,
at any time and under any circumstances, proves her skill
as a thief and her unbalance in the "get away."</p>

<p>There is her escape from the asylum at Elgin on the night
of December 25, 1904. Christmas eve she had fainted in the
arms of an attendant and in the scurrying which followed
had secured the keys to the gates. On the night of Christmas
she went out of the Elgin asylum, boarded an electric car for
Aurora and bought a railroad ticket to Peoria.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stole $1,000 Worth of Goods in Two Days.</span></h3>

<p>On the way to Peoria she relieved the conductor of $30 in
bills, secreting them in her hat. In Peoria, within forty-eight
hours, she had stolen a thousand dollars' worth of goods from
stores, registered at three hotels under assumed names, and
was in a chair car with a ticket for Omaha when the Peoria
police had followed her easy tracks through the city. Perhaps
the broadest, most easily identified track was that which she
left in a barber shop in the National Hotel, where she appeared
for an egg shampoo. Two eggs had been broken into
her shiny hair when Bertha promptly fainted and rolled out
of the chair. As a count of shop equipment showed nothing
missing an hour later, the barber shop proprietor was at a
loss as to the purpose of the faint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>This girlish young woman, with the baby dimples and skin
of peach and cream, the innocent blue eyes, and the smiles
that play so easily over her face as she talks vivaciously and
with keen sense of both wit and humor, is a study for the
psychologist. There is no affectedness of speech&mdash;for the moment
it is childishly genuine. She could sit in a drawing room
and have half a dozen admirers in her train.</p>

<p>But reform schools, asylums and penitentiaries are institutions
through which this young woman has graduated up to
that pinnacle of notorious accomplishment which today is centering
upon "Fainting Bertha" Lebecke the official attentions
of a great state. What to do with her is the question.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kept at South Bartonville Without Locks.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. George A. Zeller, superintendent of the asylum for the
incurable insane at South Bartonville, having fought for the
care of Bertha in his institution, purposes to make her a tractable
patient and willing to remain. He has the history of his
institution back of him, from whose doors and windows he
has torn away $6,000 worth of steel netting and steel bars.</p>

<p>In the first place, "Fainting Bertha" will have nothing to
gain by fainting at Bartonville; she is promised merely a
drowning dash of cold water when she falls. She can secure
no keys by fainting, for the reason that there are no keys to
doors. A nurse, wideawake for her eight-hour nursing duty,
is always at hand and always watchful.</p>

<p>"Take away the show of restraint if you would have a patient
cease fighting against restraint," is the philosophy of Dr.
Zeller. "Human vigilance always was and always will be the
greatest safeguard for the insane."</p>

<p>If "Fainting Bertha" Lebecke were a grizzled amazon, even,
she might be a simpler proposition for the state. She is too
pretty and plump, however, to think of restraining by the
harsher methods, if harsh methods are employed. She can
pass out of a storm of hysterical tears in an instant and smile
through them like a stream of sunshine. Or as quickly she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
can throw off the pretty little witticism and airy conceit of
her baby hands and become a vixen fury with blazing blue
eyes that are a warning to her antagonist.</p>

<p>And at large, exercising her charms, she can become the
"good fellow" to the everlasting disappearance of half a dozen
different valuables in one's tie or pockets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">History of "Fainting Bertha."</span></h3>

<p>Bertha Lebecke says she was born in Council Bluffs, Ia., in
1880. Save for the trick of raising her brows while animated,
thus wrinkling her forehead before her time, she might pass
easily for twenty-three years of age. In these twenty-seven
years, however, Bertha Lebecke has kept the institutions of
four states guessing&mdash;to some extent experimenting.</p>

<p>Her father was a cobbler, and there were five children, only
one other of them living. The father is dead. The mother,
with the one sister, is living in Council Bluffs. Seven asylums
and one state's prison have held her&mdash;for a time; Kankakee
three times and Elgin twice, with two escapes from each place
credited to her childish cunning. But today the face of Bertha
Lebecke in trouble anywhere in Christian civilization would
draw helping funds for less than her asking.</p>

<p>"Don't write that I am the awful creature that the papers
have pictured me," she exclaimed, with a tragic movement of
her little hands. "Oh, I have been a bad girl&mdash;I know that&mdash;but
not as bad as they accuse me of being," burying her face
in her arm.</p>

<p>But in a moment she was sitting up, dry eyed, stitching on
the bit of linen "drawn work" which she said was intended for
Gov. Deneen at Springfield.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Criticises the Linen Purchased by the State.</span></h3>

<p>"But what awful linen!" she exclaimed, holding it out to
Dr. Zeller as she sat in a ward with twenty other women inmates
regarded as among the hardest to watch and control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
among the 1,900 inmates of the great institution. "I'm surprised
at you! Can't you buy better linen than that?"</p>

<p>But while she talked and the doctor smiled, a small key fitting
nothing in particular was laid by Dr. Zeller close at
hand and it disappeared in ten seconds. Likewise a pencil
from the doctor's pocket found its way almost unnoticed into
"Fainting Bertha's" blonde hair. Her smiling face all turned
to frowns when finally, one at a time, he took the key from
her waist and the pencil from its hiding place in her hair.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know a man named Gunther?" asked Dr.
Zeller suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;what of it?" she asked quickly, with a show of nervousness.</p>

<p>"He is in the penitentiary."</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" exclaimed the girl. "I'm delighted to hear
it. He ought to have been there long ago, and he ought to
stay there the rest of his life!"</p>

<p>This was the man whom Bertha charged with responsibility
for her first wrong step as a girl, sending her first to the Glenwood
(Ia.) Home for the Feebleminded. Later she charges
that this man taught her the fainting trick, by which she
faints in the arms of a man or woman wearing jewelry or
carrying money and in the confusion biting the stone from a
pin and swallowing it, or with small, supple hand taking a
purse from a pocket or a watch from its fob, perhaps with
innocent eyes and dimpled face assisting the loser in the search
for the missing valuable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bertha Says Gunther Promised To Marry Her.</span></h3>

<p>"That man Gunther promised to marry me," she said, lowering
her voice. "He sent me out to steal and when I wouldn't
do it he used to beat me when I came home. Do you wonder
I'm what I am?"</p>

<p>There was a burst of what might have been tears. Her
face was buried and her figure shook with sobs. But in five
seconds the dimpled face appeared again, dry eyed, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
a remark on the moment she turned toward her auditors, winking
an eyelid slyly.</p>

<p>"Fainting Bertha" Lebecke has almost lost consecutive track
of the asylums and prisons in which she has been locked.</p>

<p>From this Glenwood home for the feebleminded she was released.
She got into trouble again and was sent to the Clarinda
State Hospital for the Insane. Here, in the words of the
superintendent, she was looked upon as a case of "moral imbecility,
with some maniacal complications." Here an operation
was performed, and, in the opinion of the superintendent,
she was eligible to discharge soon afterwards as improved.</p>

<p>St. Bernard's Asylum at Council Bluffs cared for her for a
time, but she succeeded in escaping from it and was not returned.</p>

<p>In Asylum No. 3 at Nevada, Mo., in spite of the close watch
kept upon her, "Fainting Bertha" escaped several times, but
was caught soon after and returned to the institution. On
December 21, 1901, she was discharged as not insane and returned
to Omaha, where she had lived for a time. Here Bertha
remained about two years, acting as a maid of all work in
households. Her experience in Chicago and Illinois is stranger
than any fiction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Most Unruly Prisoner in Joliet.</span></h3>

<p>On a charge of shoplifting she was given an indeterminate
sentence of one to ten years in the penitentiary at Joliet.</p>

<p>Records of Joliet prison show her to have been the most unruly
prisoner ever confined in that institution. Her conduct
was such that Prison Physician Fletcher declared that she was
insane and she was sent to the asylum at Kankakee.</p>

<p>Twice she escaped from Kankakee, once, she says, with the
aid of an employee of the institution, whom she refuses to
name. This first escape was made within four months of
her arrival at the institution; the second after a year. On
her return to that institution for criminals her actions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
such that the hospital authorities decided that she was not insane
and sent her back to Joliet prison.</p>

<p>On this second imprisonment "Fainting Bertha" showed
what she could do in making herself impossible even in a
prison. Her cell was in the north wing of the building, overlooking
the street. She would appear in the window with her
clothing torn to ribbons, shrieking that she was being murdered.
According to prison officials, there was no language too
impossible for her glib tongue. Her furies of temper caused
her to heap unspeakable abuse upon matrons and guards alike.
Deputy Warden Sims, responsible for order and discipline, says
he has been abused by her beyond belief. Her plan was to
sleep in daylight and make the whole night hideous with her
screams and cries and unspeakable language.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Penitentiary Glad to Be Rid of Her.</span></h3>

<p>As a last resort the tortured prison officials at Joliet, taking
the diagnosis of Physician Fletcher, sent her to the care of
Supt. Podstata at the Elgin asylum. There, after consultation
of the asylum physicians, it was found that she should
have been confined in an asylum for the feebleminded when
she was younger; that, lacking this treatment, she had grown
and developed such destructive tendencies that a hospital for
the insane was the only haven for her.</p>

<p>But Bertha escaped from the asylum, which has for its safeguards
the lock and the steel bar. Locks and bars are nothing
to "Fainting Bertha"! She was recaptured and returned, only
that she might escape again on Christmas night, finding her
way to Peoria, where her escapades in going through the town
were marvels to the Peoria police. The conductor on the
Peoria train from whom she took $30 has not claimed his
money. But half a dozen stores in which she operated and the
salesman from whose samples in the Fey Hotel she took hundreds
of dollars worth of silks, jewelry, clothing and perfumes
got back some of the plunder, which detectives found
piled around her in a chair car in an Omaha train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>The Peoria police locked her up, and while the charges
rested Dr. Zeller, of the asylum for the incurable insane at
South Bartonville, asked of Dr. Podstata and the penitentiary
authorities the custody of "Fainting Bertha." Warden Murphy
at Joliet was delighted at the idea. Supt. Podstata at Elgin
was as greatly pleased. Dr. Zeller at South Bartonville Asylum
for the Incurable Insane, receiving the young woman, was
conscious of having a unique addition to the 1,929 other inmates
of his barless cottages of detention. In the history of
the South Bartonville asylum only one female inmate has
escaped, and she was found dead soon afterwards in a ravine
into which she had fallen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pale Blue Color Scheme of Bertha's Ward.</span></h3>

<p>"If Bertha escapes here it will be the test of vigilance as
opposed to locks and steel bars," is the summing up of the
situation by Dr. Zeller. Bertha is not wholly satisfied where
she is. The food is not all she desires. She refers to her
ward and its environment as "the dump." Yet her particular
"dump" is decorated in pale blue&mdash;part of the color scheme of
the asylum management,&mdash;the color scheme of her ward being
adapted to her particular temperamental degree of insanity.
But while Bertha has been gnawing diamonds from tie pins,
one of her fraternity in ward classification has a record of
gnawing the woodwork from at least a dozen other insane
wards in as many institutions for the insane.</p>

<p>How subtly conscious of her position "Fainting Bertha" may
be on occasion was demonstrated the other day when it was
arranged with Dr. Zeller that she should go with two nurses
and the staff member in Peoria in order that her picture
might be taken in a local gallery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Delighted at Chance of Going to Town.</span></h3>

<p>With $9 to her credit in the asylum's system of personal
accounts, Bertha wanted some of this sum for "shopping,"
but when it was refused she accepted the situation without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> particular
protest. The idea of going uptown, five miles from
South Bartonville, was delightful. Her spirits rose high at
the idea, and when her nurses had brought her over to the administration
building she dropped into the office chair occupied
by Dr. Zeller, and in mock seriousness turned to the little
group, asking what she could do for them.</p>

<p>On the Pekin and Peoria electric road she was banked in
next the window by her escorts, and was the pink of propriety
until Peoria was reached, save as occasionally she turned backward
toward the conductor and smiled. And invariably the
conductor smiled in return!</p>

<p>"Honey" was her designation of Nurse Quick. "I'm a perfect
lady, ain't I, Honey?" she repeated a score of times on the
trip. In the photographer's gallery the snap of the camera
shutter brought a start from the object of the lens, and the
first picture in six years, save as the police authority of the
state had insisted that she pose for it.</p>

<p>But after the ordeal at the photographer's Bertha wanted
most of all a "square meal." Miss Quick knew of a restaurant
where quiet prevailed and where there would be little incentive
to Bertha to faint, and there the little party adjourned
for the "square meal." Pie&mdash;apple or mince&mdash;was the dessert.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Took Pie and Candy Back "Home."</span></h3>

<p>"You won't mind, honey, if I take a pie home, will you?"</p>

<p>Miss Quick didn't mind at all. And not minding the pie,
Miss Bertha promptly buttered four rolls liberally and included
in the package a bunch of celery which had been left
over after she had passed it around insistently, time and again.
At the candy counter just outside the dining room Bertha
balked amiably.</p>

<p>"I don't like to presume on your good nature, but I know
you won't object to a small box of candy?" she purred.</p>

<p>The nurse didn't object to the 25-cent box; which was an
inspiration to "Fainting Bertha."</p>

<p>"But don't you think this is ever so much nicer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The nurse had to admit that it was. It was a half-dollar
box of mixed candies!</p>

<p>"But I'm afraid it looks like imposing on your good nature
just a little?" she smiled, as the cashier proceeded to wrap it
up. "And you don't mind, honey?" to Miss Quick, who smiled
indulgently, and with the pie, rolls, and celery in one hand
and the box of candy in the other, Bertha started back to the
Asylum for the Incurable Insane at South Bartonville, five
miles away.</p>

<p>But even the genial Dr. Zeller and his barless windows and
lockless prison proved in time to be enervating to such a restless
being as "Fainting Bertha." So, during June, 1908, she
made no less than three attempts to escape. She was, however,
apprehended in each case before she reached Peoria, and
returned to the asylum. The authorities declare that she was
really playing for theatrical effect rather than from any desire
to get away from Bartonville. Be that as it may, the fact
remains that if she desires to get out of Bartonville she probably
will, as she is the most resourceful criminal of her sex
known to the authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>
<h2><a id="FRONT">FRONT.</a></h2>


<p>A good front is a distinct asset. A good front is made up
of neat, clean clothes, on a clean body, the whole housing a
clean mind. A man with clean clothes on a dirty body, or dirty
clothes on a clean body, is not wanted anywhere in the business
world; and there is no place in the heavens above or the
earth beneath, or the waters under the earth, that has room
for the man with the dirty mind.</p>

<p>But with the clean mind inside the clean body, and neat,
simple, clean clothes on the outside of it, the young man has
all the essentials of a good front. Anything more is superfluous
and tends to make him ridiculous. Simplicity is the
keynote.</p>

<p>This moralizing on the value of front is suggested by observations
and comparisons of the habits of certain Chicago millionaires,
and the ways of some of their cheap clerks, the latter
having exaggerated ideas of putting up a false appearance of
prosperity.</p>

<p>These comparisons were so striking that they attracted the
attention of Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge, and during the
course of his regular work he found time to tabulate a little,
with startling results.</p>

<p>The detective found that there are in Chicago many young
men living on very meager salaries, who have such exaggerated
notions of the value of a prosperous appearance that they overshoot
the mark, and frequently, as result of trying, as they
think, to "look like a millionaire," they often succeed in looking
very much like the famous animal with very long ears and a
loud voice which one spoke to the prophet Baalam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/img087.jpg" width="481" height="550" alt="(Man in top hat walking next to man in buggy)" />
</div>

<p>"It is easy to distinguish the real millionaire," said the great
detective, in discussing this subject. "If he wants to get anywhere
in a great city and his automobile happens to be engaged,
he takes the same means of getting there as does the toiler in
the mills or factory; he walks, or he rubs elbows on the street
cars with the laboring men, many of whom never know that
they are brushing against the owner of millions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stanley Field's Buggy.</span></h3>

<p>"Stanley Field runs around town in a crazy old country
buggy, just like a farmer. He took this method of going about
when the great teamsters' strike was on, and he was a member
of the Merchants' committee.</p>

<p>"But I will bet you a good cigar that there are any number
of little snippety ten-dollar clerks in the great establishment
of which Stanley Field is the head, who would feel themselves
eternally disgraced if they were seen in that buggy.</p>

<p>"Not for little mister-ten-dollar clerk! No, sir. He must
go out and spend three dollars for a cab if he wants to get
down town to a theatre. It is just this silly pride that makes
forgers and embezzlers.</p>

<p>"My advice to young men would be, 'Keep your mind clean,
your body clean and your clothes neat and clean. Never mind
about fancy show. Men will respect you more if you follow
this advice than they will if you squander money foolishly in
the effort to put up a false front which deceives no one.'"</p>

<p>Out of hundreds of cases which Wooldridge has run down,
where embezzlement, forgery and theft, even of the pettiest
sort, was at the bottom of the crime, the great detective declares
that fully half of the cases had their origin in this silly attempt
to appear something more than the real thing. Silly pride is a
teacher of crime, and a sure school mistress she is.</p>

<p>And the absurdity, the bally foolishness of it all, is that
these pitiful attempts deceive no one. Every one knows solidity
when they see it, just as they know sham when they see it. A
self-respecting young man cannot afford to make of himself a
sham, even by taking a cab when the millionaires walk or take
the street car.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fake Pride Leads to Crime.</span></h3>

<p>On the other hand, many young men have plunged into a
life of crime through over-spending their salaries, in the effort
to convince every one who looked at them that they were on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
directorate of the Standard Oil Company. Where the millionaire
walks these silly young jackasses take a cab, and pay half
a day's salary in order to ride two or three blocks.</p>

<p>"I have seen John J. Mitchell, the president of the Illinois
Trust and Savings Bank, and one of our foremost financiers,
walk from the Northwestern station to the bank building, while
right behind him a young donkey, who was working for $25 a
week in that very bank, would pay a cabby a dollar to drive him
the seven short blocks from that same station to the bank.</p>

<p>"It is just such young pinheads as that who afterwards turn
out to be our embezzlers, forgers and financial criminals."</p>

<p>The man who has made a name which is known in every
corner of the United States as an authority on all kinds of
frauds, snorted his indignation as he thought of the silly bank
clerk. Then he continued:</p>

<p>"Does anybody ever see Arthur Meeker take a cab to ride a
few blocks? Not on your life. He walks. So does Cyrus McCormick,
Harold McCormick, R. Hall McCormick, Frank Lowden,
and any number of the other men whose names stand at the
top of Chicago finance. I see Frank Lowden on the Indiana
avenue cars, the line I take myself, time after time. He is one
of the most democratic of men."</p>

<h2><a id="LAST_CHANCE_GONE">LAST CHANCE GONE.</a></h2>

<h3>IDENTIFICATION BUREAU AIDED BY NATURE.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>The Criminal and the Crooked Members of the Human Race
Have a New and Dangerous Enemy in the
Finger Print Method of Identification.</b></p>


<p>The last hope of the enemies of society, the habitual criminals,
is gone. The Bertillon system sounded the death knell of the
criminal so far as capture was concerned. The finger print
system, as first set forth by Sir Francis Galton and elaborated
by Sir Edward Henry, has made possible the absolute identification
after capture.</p>

<p>One of the first men to see the tremendous possibilities of
the finger print system, as applied to the identification of suspects,
was Detective Clifton E. Wooldridge of Chicago. Through
his efforts and that of others equally interested in the exact
identification of criminals, the Chicago Police Department established
the finger print method of identification in 1905, as
a Supplement to the Bertillon system which was established in
1887.</p>

<p>The Bertillon system catches the suspect. The finger print
system makes sure that he is the criminal. The Bertillon system,
while a splendid thing for catching the thief, still left some
loop-holes which needed strengthening. This was supplied by
the finger print system. Like the man and woman referred to
in Longfellow's Hiawatha it is a case of "useless each without
the other." When the two systems are worked together there
is absolutely no possible escape for the apprehended suspect.</p>

<p>The Chicago Police Bureau of Identification is the second
largest in the world, and contains over 70,000 pictures.</p>

The Bertillon System of Identification by Measurement.</div>
</div>

<p>By combining the Bertillon measurements with the finger-print
system the police department has woven a network of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
identification around the criminal which makes it practically
an impossibility for him ever to disguise himself should he at
any future time fall into the hands of the officials of the law.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px;">
<img src="images/img089.jpg" width="546" height="550" alt="(Fingerprint form)" />
</div>

<p>The finger print method was discovered about forty years
ago by Sir William Herschell, then an English official in India.
Sir Francis Galton, a Fellow of the Royal Society, was the
first to systematize it, and the first to establish the fact that
the papillary ridges of the fingers did not change through life.
This was nearly twenty years ago. Sir Francis Galton made
the calculation that the chance of any two sets of finger prints
being the same is one in 16,400,000,000, and as an article from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
which the writer quotes states, "there are only 1,600,000,000
people in the world," its population would have to be increased
ten times before two people were identical and means that a
finger print as a mark of identification is practically infallible.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Perfected in London.</span></h4>

<p>Sir Edward Henry, Chief Police Commissioner, London,
England, is the man who perfected the system, as it is now
used, classifying finger prints by signs and numerals, so that
it is now considered perfect.</p>

<p>The finger prints of women are the same as men, except in
size, while the prints of negroes are the clearest and strongest,
owing to the thickness of skin and moisture from perspiration,
and it has not yet been demonstrated that finger prints are any
indication of character.</p>

<p>While quite a large number of cities and penal institutions
in the United States have adopted and are now using the Bertillon
system of criminal identification, it is to be regretted
that it has not been more generally adopted by all cities of a
population not less than 5,000, and by all penitentiaries, reformatories
and county jails. Universally applied under competent
instructors, nearly every professional criminal would,
in a few years, be recorded, so that it would only become necessary
to keep up with the new additions to the ranks of the
criminal classes.</p>

<p>It has been thoroughly established that the papillary ridges
of fingers never change during life. From infancy to senility
and until long after death no change ensues in the fingers.
Though partially destroyed by injury, the original lines retain
their pristine characteristics when healed.</p>

<p>This is nature's method of identification, and no record can
be found of the digits of two persons having exactly the same
characteristics. Numerous instances could be cited of twins
and triplets whose finger prints afforded the only means of distinguishing
one from the other.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAKING FINGER PRINTS.</h3>

<p>Instruments required: A piece of tin, ordinary printer's ink,
and a 10-cent rubber roller are all the tools necessary for getting
the impression. It requires no special training to take
finger impression, and any rural constable can, with ten minutes'
practice, take a set of good finger prints in five minutes.
After having a week's practice he could take them in three
minutes.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Scotland Yard Method.</span></h4>

<p>At Scotland Yard a metallic brace is in use for the purpose
of forcing refractory prisoners to leave correct impressions upon
the records. One application of this brace is persuasive enough
to cause the culprit to hasten to comply with a request for his
signature.</p>

<p>A small slab stone is covered with ink, which is distributed
with a sprayer, and the prisoner is compelled to place his
fingers in the ink and then firmly implant them upon paper.</p>

<p>On a regular prescribed form impressions are taken so that
the flexure of the last joint shall be at a given point on the
record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>The digits are taken singly and then an imprint is made of
all of them simultaneously.</p>

<p>When the prisoner has finished imprinting the record he is
called upon for his signature, and immediately underneath the
name, as written by himself, an imprint is left of the right forefinger.</p>

<p>For the edification of American police, Mr. Ferrier demonstrates
that upon a sheet of paper you may sprinkle some charcoal
dust and press it upon the paper with your thumb and then
blow the dust off and the imprint of the digit will remain.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Most Positive Identification.</span></h4>

<p>But this thumb print possibility in commercial papers has
its greatest future in the positive identification which either
thumb or finger print carries with it. Criminologists all over
the world have satisfied themselves of the absolute accuracy of
the finger print identification. It would be hard to figure just
how many Constantines were arrested or kept under surveillance
following the horrible murder in Chicago, the suspicions aroused
by personal resemblances to the criminal's photograph and
especially by the prominent gold tooth of the man. But in a
criminal's finger print the merest novice anywhere in the world
may take an ink impression of the fingers of the suspected
criminal, and if these prints should be in the bureau of identification
at Scotland Yard, with its 100,000 records of individuals,
the man would be identified positively within half an
hour&mdash;identified not only by the experts of the bureau, but an
ordinary citizen would be an authority in attesting the proof.</p>

<p>This is a suggestion of the absolute accuracy of identifications
on commercial paper. At the present time traveling
salesmen who spend much money and who wish to carry as
little as possible of cash with them, have an organized system
by which their bankable paper may be cashed at hotels and
business houses over the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Applied to Immigrants.</span></h4>

<p>Major R. W. McClaughry, warden of the federal prison at
Leavenworth, sees in the finger print system a possibility which
might be taken cognizance of by the government at Ellis
Island. With the millions of immigrants who have come and
who still are to come to these shores, the finger print requirement
would simplify many of the tangles of many kinds which
result from this inrush of foreign population.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that many of this country's criminals
are foreign born, it remains that civil identifications of such
people are matters of great moment. Titles and estates have
hung in the balance of incomplete identifications of persons who
are claimants in the United States. Fifty years after a finger
print is registered that same finger, or group of fingers, will
prove the personality of the one registering. In case of accidents
of many kinds one hand or the other is most likely to
escape mutilation, and a post-mortem imprint of the fingers
still is proof of identity.</p>

<p>The finger print system is being taken up more rapidly than
was the Bertillon, largely owing to the fact that police departments,
recognizing that a scientific system gives far greater results
and can in no way be compared with the old method of
describing criminals, by color, age, height, weight, eyes, hair,
etc., are more willing than formerly to intelligently investigate
and test new methods.</p>

<p>Under the Bertillon system it is contended that the bones of
the human anatomy stop growing after the age of twenty-one
years. In consequence measurements taken of juvenile offenders
under that age are practically of little use, as they
show too wide a variance with measurements taken in after
years, and are not a certain source of identification.</p>

<p>The identification from imprint taken from the finger tips
of both hands can be recorded as soon as the child is born, and
no matter at what time of life a record is again taken of the
subject, absolute identification can be had, as the papillary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
ridges of the palmer surface of the finger tips present the same
formation until death, and even though some of the fingers
become mutilated, amputated or lost, sufficient prints would
remain on the other fingers to produce identification.</p>

<p>While it is claimed that the finger print system is sufficient
unto itself for all identification, after working each system side
by side for a number of years, I believe that both systems should
be installed in all cities, penitentiaries, etc., especially as they
both will be given an impartial and thorough test here, with
the result that it will be the survival of both, or of the fittest.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Keep Bad Men Out of Service.</span></h4>

<p>In these government departments it is expected that the
finger print records will serve to keep undesirable people out
of the service, as well as to afford a complete method of identifying
every member, or past member, in years to come.</p>

<p>Both branches of the War Department, the army and navy,
had first installed the Bertillon system, and within the last
year the finger print system, thereby recognizing both, but apparently
giving the finger print system the preference; owing
to the many ways it can be applied in the service, and especially
as to recording all enlisted men and to the identification
of those who might be maimed or killed in battle, whose identity
might be sought afterward, or to identify deserters; or if
a soldier or sailor has lost his honorable discharge paper, he can
go to any enlisting office, have his finger prints taken, his identity
established, and new papers issued, thereby avoiding red
tape or having about one dozen affidavits from different people
to substantiate his claim.</p>

<p>Not only as a means of detecting and identifying criminals
may the finger print be used, but its usefulness in various ways
is easily demonstrated.</p>

<p>It is clearly within the range of possibility that the traveler
a few years hence may be called upon to imprint an identifying
finger mark upon his letter of credit or certified check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img092.jpg" width="600" height="285" alt="(Fingerprints on check.)" />
</div>

<p>As a means of preventing-fraud or securing the signatures of
those who cannot write, the finger print system is invaluable, as
the mark may be easily forged, but the finger's impress can be
only made by the proper party and cannot be duplicated by
others.</p>

<p>The thumb or finger tips will leave an imprint upon glass,
polished metal or wood, owing to the moisture and natural oil
oozing from the cuticle. It is a simple matter to procure such
imprints when wanted, and they can be turned over to the authorities
for identification of a suspect.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Secure Prints of All Criminals.</span></h4>

<p>If peace officers throughout the country would secure finger
prints of all criminals passing through their hands and forward
them to a central bureau it would facilitate the apprehension
and identification of malefactors.</p>

<p>As a preventive of repeating at elections, the finger print
identification would serve an admirable purpose. When an
elector registered he could leave an imprint of his fingers upon
the registration book, and when he went to vote a glance at the
registration list and comparison of the imprint made at the
polls would readily establish his identity if the prints tallied.</p>

<p>The natives of India decline to recognize the validity of any
document beneath the signature of which is not imprinted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
reproduction of the whorls or loops of the thumb of the
signer, alleging that a person might deny his own signature,
but that the finger prints afford incontrovertible evidence, as
no two people can make the same impression with their thumbs
upon paper.</p>

<p>Upon opening an account with a bank in India the depositor
leaves the impress of his right thumb upon the roll of depositors
and none of his paper will be honored unless checks are
thus imprinted.</p>

<p>In the same country pensioners are compelled to imprint
their thumbs upon receipts for pension money, and thus obviate
the likelihood of other persons drawing the stipend rightfully
belonging to the veteran.</p>

<p>The best test of a system is its practical use and the results
derived, and one of the most important matters is uniformity
in all branches of work, classification, filing, size of cards, etc.,
so that, as the system becomes universal, it will be operated
on identical lines in all countries. From my observation of
the practical workings of the system, I believe that at New
Scotland Yard, London, to be the best.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Finger Print System Furnishes Complete Identification.</span></h4>

<p>In Paris a public house or saloon was broken into one morning,
and it was found that the owner had been murdered and
that apparently there was no clew to the murderer.</p>

<p>On arriving at the saloon they found a table on which drinks
had been served, and on which were found a number of glasses.
On close investigation finger prints were discovered on each.
Finger prints were also found on a knife by the side of the
body and on a decanter. On comparison it was found that the
prints were made by the same person. On causing the arrest
of the different people who had been seen to visit the saloon
they were finger-printed and a comparison made, with the result
that the murderer was arrested and a confession obtained
within ten days, followed by conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>At New Scotland Yard, London, a little boy was brought
in and two sets of his finger prints taken and filed away in
separate steel deposit vaults. The boy was an orphan and an
heir to a very large fortune in Africa. His finger prints were
taken as a protection, so that if anything happened to him, or
he disappeared, or he had to prove his identity to claim his
estate, or provided he died and proof of the identity of the
body was required, such proof could be shown with absolute
certainty.</p>

<p>An interesting case nearer home is that of a recent arrest in
Chicago of a man that the authorities were convinced was a
professional criminal, and from his accent and other indications
they believed him to be an English professional crook.</p>

<p>His Bertillon measurements and finger prints were taken at
the Bureau of Identification by Captain M. P. Evans, superintendent
of the bureau, and a copy of the photograph and finger
prints given to Mr. William A. Pinkerton, of the Pinkerton
National Detective Agency.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinkerton, who is a personal friend of Frank C. Froest,
superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Department of
New Scotland Yard, London, mailed the finger prints to him
without any other memorandum, data or the picture, simply
making the test on the finger prints. He received a reply from
Inspector Frank C. Froest, giving the name of the criminal,
and a long record of some fourteen arrests and the picture, so
as to authenticate the identification, and also a statement from
Superintendent Froest that the identification was made inside
of three minutes from a collection of over 70,000 records.</p>

<p>The identification was absolutely correct. The prisoner, on
being shown the letter, admitted his guilt.</p>

<p>If a clerk handles papers or letters on his employer's desk,
it is a very easy matter of detection. By means of a little
syringe filled with a powder blown on the paper, the finger
prints are reproduced with startling clearness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Broken Glass Proves Guilt.</span></h4>

<p>Some pieces of broken glass had been taken to Scotland
Yard, four days previous to the Ward, Lock &amp; Co. burglary.
These fragments of glass had been picked up at the London
City Mission, where a burglar had broken through a window
and carried off a clock and other articles. No one could be
connected with the crime after a most thorough detective hunt.</p>

<p>The one remaining source was a bit of glass on which finger
prints had been noticed. These were photographed and compared
with the finger prints of all the recent records. Surprisingly
enough, they corresponded exactly with those of the
young clerk who had been found stealing books from the publishers'
warehouse. Instead of being a clerk, he was a very
adept young burglar. On this new evidence the prisoner was
sentenced to twelve months at hard labor.</p>

<p>About a month before this a similar case occurred in London.
A man was arrested on Tower Hill carrying a pair of boots
wrapped up in a brown paper. He said he had been employed
to carry the parcel to Fenchurch Street Station. He was held
on suspicion. Later in the day it was discovered that the boots
had been stolen from a neighboring store, and that on the transom,
which had been broken, there was a perfect imprint of a
man's finger.</p>

<p>Inspector Collins, superintendent of the finger print department
at New Scotland Yard, examined the print and found
it corresponded to the mark of the suspected man's left forefinger
made on the brown paper parcel in which the boots were
wrapped. The evidence was conclusive, the man pleaded
guilty, and was sentenced to nine months at hard labor.</p>

<p>About the same time another interesting case occurred in
Staffordshire, England. There had been a wholesale burglary
of a large jeweler's shop. The perpetrator had left distinct
finger marks on a plate glass shelf in a window. These marks
were photographed and sent to New Scotland Yard. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
identified as belonging to William Davis, a notorious burglar
who had been confined at Wakefield prison in 1901.</p>

<p>The man was hunted up. He was found living near the
place of the recent robbery under the name of John McNally.
He at first denied the recent offense, but afterward made a
full confession. But for these tell-tale finger marks, he might
have continued to ply his trade unsuspected under his new
name, in a district where the local police did not know him.</p>

<p>In one of the large banks where the finger print system
was introduced, they make it a rule that when a depositor cannot
read or write, he shall, in addition to making his mark
in the old way on checks or documents, place the finger print
of the thumb or index finger on them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Important in Will Contests.</span></h4>

<p>Finger prints are also used in the making of wills, so that
while the signature of the testator may be contested, it is almost
impossible to contest the signature of the fingers, for so
long as the skin of the fingers of the dead person can be taken
up, just so long can the finger print impression be obtained to
verify the living imprint.</p>

<p>It is only a question of time before all large transportation
companies, like express and railways, whose employes handle
packages of money or other valuables, will be required to place
their finger prints on file, so that when money or valuables are
missing the cover of the package will indicate who handled or
tampered with it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How to Detect a Forger.</span></h4>

<p>How to detect a forger as one of the cleverest of operating
criminals has been solved by the "thumb print" method of
identification now spreading through the rogues' galleries of
the world.</p>

<p>It is quite as interesting as the suggestion that through the
same thumb print method in commercial and banking houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the forger is likely to become a creature without occupation and
chirographical or other means of support.</p>

<p>The system is not only a great aid in preventing the forgeries
of commercial brigands, but the easiest of all means
for a person in a strange city to identify himself as the lawful
possessor of check, or note, or bank draft which he may wish
to turn into cash at a banker's window.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Used in Ancient Times.</span></h4>

<p>A thousand years ago the Chinese were using the thumb
print signatures in commercial business. Its practical adaptation
today is explained at a glance in the check reproduced
here, as it was filled out by Mr. McClaughry himself. In this
check the design is that the maker of the check, before leaving
home for a distant city, shall draw the check for the needed
sum and, in the presence of the cashier of his bank, place one
thumb print in ink somewhere over the amount of the check
as written in figures. Thereupon the cashier of the bank will
accept the check as certified by his institution. With this paper
in his possession the drawer of the check may go from his home
in New York to San Francisco, stranger to every person in
the city, but at the window of any bank in that city, presenting
his certified check to a teller who has a reading glass at
his hand, the stranger may satisfy the most careful of banks
by a mere imprint of his thumb somewhere else upon the face
of the check.</p>

<p>Had this simple thumb print been used in the Stensland
bank, no handwriting expert would have been needed to establish
the genuineness of any note under question.</p>

<p>With the ink thumb print of the cashier of a bank placed
on a bank draft over his signature and over the written amount
of the draft, chemical papers and the dangers of "raising" or
counterfeiting the draft would be an impossibility. The
thumb prints of the secretary of the United States treasury,
reproduced on the face of greenback, silver certificate and bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
note of any series, would discourage counterfeiting as nothing
else ever has done.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Safeguard on Seals of Letters and Money Packages.</span></h4>

<p>As an aid in the transmission of sealed packages, the thumb
print is invaluable. The print will determine absolutely
whether the wax has been broken in transit, and it will also
establish the identity of the person putting on the seal.</p>

<p>Packages so protected have been left by train robbers where
all other packages in the safe were taken. The thumb print
was too suggestive of danger to make tampering with such
packages safe.</p>

<p>In the ordinary usage of the thumb print on bankable paper,
the city bank having its country correspondents everywhere,
often is called upon to cash a draft drawn by the country bank
in favor of that bank's customer, who may be a stranger in
the city. The city bank desires to accommodate the country
correspondent as a first proposition.</p>

<p>The unidentified bearer of the draft in the city, may have no
acquaintance able to identify him. If he presents the draft at
the window of the big bank, hoping to satisfy the institution
and is turned away, he feels hurt. By the thumb print method
he might have his money in a moment.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Identifying Strangers.</span></h4>

<p>In the first place, even the signature of the cashier of the
country bank will be enough to satisfy its correspondent in
the city of the genuineness of the draft. Before the country
purchaser of the draft has left the bank issuing the paper he
will be required to make the ink thumb print in a space for
that purpose. Without this imprint the draft will have no
value. If the system should be in use, the cashier signing
the draft will not affix his signature to the paper until this
imprint has been made in his presence.</p>

<p>Then, with his attested finger print on the face of the draft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the stranger in the city may go to the city bank, appearing at
the window of the newest teller, if need be. This teller will
have at hand his ink pad, faced with a sheet of smooth tin. He
never may have seen the customer before. He never may see
him again. But under the magnifying influences of an ordinary
reading glass he may know, past the possibility of doubt,
that in the hands of the proper person named in the draft, the
imprint which is made before him has been made by the first
purchaser of the draft.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Signing Bonds and Stocks.</span></h4>

<p>In the more important and complicated transactions in bank
paper one bank may forward from the bank itself the finger
print proofs of identity. The whole field of such necessities
is open to adapted uses of the method. Notes given by one
bank to another in high figures may be protected in every way
by these imprints. Stock issues and institution bonds would
be worthy of the thumb print precautions, as would be every
other form of paper which might tempt either the forger or
the counterfeiter. In any case, where the authenticity of the
paper might be questioned the finger print would serve as absolute
guarantee. In stenographic correspondence, where there
might be inducements to write unauthorized letters on the part
of some person with wrong intent, the imprint of finger or
thumb would make the possibility of fraud too remote for
fears. For, in addition to the security of signatures in real
documents, the danger in attempting frauds of this kind is increased.</p>

<p>The beauty of the finger print system is that there is
absolutely no chance for error. The finger prints of the child
of eighteen months will be the same as the finger prints of the
man of eighty. No laceration, wound, or mutilation can
disturb the essentials of the outline of the finger print. The only
escape for the criminal is to cut off all of his fingers, and
even then the toe prints would be as effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the physical necessities in registering finger prints,
they are simple and inexpensive. A block of wood faced with
smooth tin or zinc the size of an octavo volume, a small ink
roller, and a tube of black ink are all that is required. For
removing the ink on the thumb or finger a towel and alcohol
cleanser are sufficient. A tip impression or a "rolled" finger
signature may be used. Only a few seconds are required for
the operation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Objects to Having Finger Impressions Recorded.</span></h4>

<p>In one of our prisons recently, a man who had just been
sentenced was brought up, and while he made no opposition
to being measured by the Bertillon system, he objected strongly
to having his finger impressions recorded. This caused the
identification expert to be suspicious, and he submitted a duplicate
record to the Scotland Yard police, in London, with the
result that the man was at once identified as a murderer who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
had escaped from a prison in England, and was taken back
there. When confronted with the English record, the convict
at once admitted his identity.</p>

<p>An express company lost a large sum of money which was
being sent from one point to another in a sealed package.
During transmission the seals were broken, the money abstracted
and the package resealed with wax. At first the express
company were absolutely unable to locate the thief, but
later on it was discovered that in resealing the package, the
thief had wet his finger and pressed it on the warm wax,
leaving a distinct imprint. The finger impressions of all the
agents through whose hands the package passed, were taken,
with the result that the thief was easily identified, a confession
obtained and the money recovered.</p>

<p>A jewelry store was entered and valuable diamonds that
were on display on glass trays in the windows were stolen. In
doing this the thieves left the imprints of their fingers on the
glass. An expert, on making investigation with a powerful
magnifier, discovered the imprints and by a careful photographic
process was able to reproduce them on paper. A research
being made among a collection of 20,000 finger-print
records revealed the fact that the prints left on the glass tray
were those of a well-known professional burglar, whose record
had been taken some two years previously, while undergoing
sentence in State prison. As a result the man was arrested
and, through him, his partner in the crime, resulting in a
conviction and the recovery of most of the goods.</p>

<p>The London police in investigating a burglary discovered
in the pantry of a house a partly empty bottle of ale, which
had been full the previous day. There were finger prints on
the bottle, which was protected by a cardboard shield and
taken to Scotland Yard, where the prints of the photograph,
afterwards, were found to correspond with those of McAllister,
who had just previously been released from jail. McAllister,
on his arrest, in some way learned that they had his finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
prints, and, realizing their value as evidence, made a circumstantial
admission which led to the recovery of the goods and
the conviction of his partner, Alexander Harley, on whose
premises the property was found.</p>

<p>A half-empty bottle of wine was discovered in the room of
an old woman at Asnieres, France, she having been murdered.
A close examination of the bottle revealed finger prints, which
were submitted to M. Bertillon, the great identification expert,
who caused large photographs to be made, and who, after
research, declared they were the imprints of a hospital attendant
named Gales, who has since been arrested, charged
with the murder, and convicted.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Murder Revealed by Finger Prints.</span></h4>

<p>Recently in London a murder was committed, and in order
to destroy any chance of detection, the murderer took the tin
of his shoe lace and cut the tips of his fingers in all directions.
He was suspected of the crime and arrested. The officers
found blood prints on the furniture and other things in the
house where the murder was committed, and when the man's
fingers healed his prints were taken and corresponded exactly
with those discovered by the officers; conviction followed.</p>

<p>Where large bodies of Chinese or negroes are employed on
government or public work it is often difficult to stop men
from representing themselves as being other men and signing
the pay roll to obtain the wages due others. Nowadays the
thumb print of each employee is taken and when he comes
up to draw his money and there is any doubt as to his identity
he makes a fresh imprint, which easily disposes of the matter.
Rich men disposing of their property by will, in addition to
their regular signature, also place the finger prints of both
hands on the paper, thereby insuring the authenticity of the
document. An easy way to protect a check is to put the thumb
print where the figures are written in.</p>

<p>Among the most noted of these is the case of Thomas Wilson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
who a few years ago committed a burglary and most atrocious
murder near Windsor, England.</p>

<p>Besides the bludgeon with which he felled his unsuspecting
victim, Wilson carried a lantern which was blackened by
smoke, and, after accomplishing his design of robbery, the
fiend took his departure.</p>

<p>As he made his escape after the foul murder, Wilson picked
up the smoke-begrimed lantern and left upon it an imprint
of a thumb wet with the blood of his victim.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Sent to Gallows by Bloody Thumb Print.</span></h4>

<p>With the cunning of the criminal he covered his tracks, and
as a last resort Chief Henry of Scotland Yard secured the
lantern bearing the tell-tale print and resolved to try the efficiency
of the ancient Chinese method of fixing responsibility
by finger tracks.</p>

<p>This astute detective had paid some attention to the fact
that no two hands would leave a similar imprint, and, working
upon this theory, he pursued a still hunt until he found a
man whose right thumb made an imprint identical with that
upon the lantern. When found, vigorous denial followed accusation,
but measurements were drawn to such a fine point
that the culprit finally confessed and expiated his heinous
crime upon the gallows.</p>

<p>Recently the perpetrator of an extensive burglary in the
jewelry shop of Mr. Bickley, Lord Mayor of Staffordshire,
England, left the imprint of his fingers upon a plate glass
shelf. The shelf was sent to Scotland Yard and the finger-print
record disclosed a duplicate in the records left by the
digits of William Davis, well known to the authorities. When
confronted with the mute evidences of guilt the culprit confessed.</p>

<p>In a police court at London a few months ago a man appeared
who declined to give any name or address. A detective
thought he recognized him as John White, wanted for a jewel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
robbery some time before, though his facial appearance had
changed and did not tally with photographs held by the police.
However, the imprint left by his fingers when in custody before
had not changed a particle and his identity was established.</p>

<p>After the success attained in numerous instances the authorities
at Scotland Yard decided to adopt the system and have
now so perfected it that no malefactor who leaves a finger
print can hope to escape ultimate punishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Wm. A. Pinkerton, of the famous Pinkerton's National
Detective Agency, and without doubt one of the greatest
criminal experts, on his return from Europe, in an interview
published recently, says: "During my visit at New Scotland
Yard, London, I was greatly interested in the high state of
efficiency which the finger print system of identification has
reached in the police service of London. The Bureau of Finger
Prints there is one of the most marvelous departments I
ever examined. Identification of criminals has been reduced
practically to a matter of bookkeeping. You get the finger
print and then simply turn up your indexes, and you know
your man at once. A criminal may shave or grow his beard, become
stout or thin, alter his appearance to a considerable extent,
but the one constant feature of his makeup is his finger
prints.</p>

<p>"The only safe way for criminals nowadays is to wear gloves
when they go out on a job, for the impressions they leave of
the fingers are found by detectives on glasses, newspapers, dusty
tables, and the slightest impression of the fingers on a damp
table or paper can, by the process in use at the Yard, serve
as an adequate means of identification."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government to Keep Watch on Criminals.</span></h4>

<p>The United States government at Washington, D. C., has
established a criminal identification bureau, or what may be
called an "Habitual Criminal Registry," for keeping the records
of all men convicted of crimes against the federal laws, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
also all indicted by grand juries of the United States courts.
The bureau is to be under the supervision of the department
of justice, and all prisons in the United States where government
prisoners are or have been confined have been directed
to send their records, consisting of photographs, Bertillon
measurement cards and finger-print identification sheets immediately
to the department of justice.</p>

<p>This bureau is intended to be used for the identification of
federal lawbreakers. It has been urged for some time by criminologists.
Heretofore each prison in the United States has
kept its own records, and a federal lawbreaker could serve a
term in one prison and be freed without the fact ever becoming
known that he had served a previous term for a similar
offense in another penitentiary.</p>

<p>Now all records are to be classified in Washington, and not
in any of the federal jails or prisons. The Bertillon measurements,
photographs and <em class="italic">finger prints</em> of the convicts are
to be taken and sent to the central bureau.</p>

<p>Also, the records of all men suspected of being yeggmen, train
or postoffice robbers are to be taken. Those held in federal
jails under indictment, etc., are to be sent there.</p>

<p>This bureau will ascertain the record of each man from
the date he has, and if one not yet given trial proves to be an
habitual criminal, this fact will be made known to the prosecuting
attorney and the judge previous to the hearing, and
if the man is convicted it will mean that he will be given the
limit sentence.</p>

<p>At the present time there are about 8,000 known criminals
who violate the government laws, and a close tab is to be kept
upon these in the future. It will go hard on a known criminal
convicted in a United States court hereafter.</p>

<div class="description">
<p>Unlocking a door is one of the easiest tasks of the professional burglar. His
ingenuity defies the efforts of locksmiths to invent safety devices. The picture
shows how an expert turns a key in the lock, and also a simple device to prevent
this.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>The up-to-date burglar must have a motor car, the use of
which is only a part of his scientific equipment. That the modern
burglar does not consider that he is properly equipped unless
he possesses a motor car is an incontrovertible fact. House-breaking
nowadays has been reduced to a science. The use
of gloves renders detection by finger prints impossible. Besides,
the modern burglar's tools are most scientifically made.
The men who make it their business to manufacture these
tools are first-class workmen.</p>

<p>The majority of large country burglaries are planned for
days in advance, and every detail is most carefully arranged.
In some mysterious manner the word is conveyed to the gang
that a visit will be made on a certain day, by a member of
the household which it is intended to rob, to a jeweler's shop.
The train is met at the terminus and the person followed to
the jeweler's or wherever they go.</p>

<p>When they enter the shop a man strolls in casually and
makes some inquiries. While an assistant is attending to his
supposed wants it is very easy for him to see what the person
at the same counter is purchasing and, having obtained all
the necessary information, the man leaves and imparts all his
information to his confederates.</p>

<p>Before a county ball or such function a visit to the jeweler's
is often necessary to get the family diamonds, and the fact
that this visit is going to be made is either communicated
or anticipated, and the same system of following is put in
operation. Equipped with all the desired information, the
modern burglar then brings his motor car into operation.
There is no tedious waiting for trains; he simply drives down
to the "crib" and avoids the old-fashioned way of taking a
train at a small wayside station, with the chances of being
arrested on his arrival in the metropolis.</p>

<p>If he is noticed on the road he is taken for a rich man
touring in his car, and if a great social function is in progress
he is regarded as a belated guest. The car is carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
stalled in an obscure place while the robbery takes place. The
booty is subsequently placed in it and a quick trip back to town
is made. The police are left practically without a single
clew.</p>

<p>Those members of the community who make a business, or
a profession, rather, of burglary keep up with the march of
science quite as closely as do people in a more legitimate
calling.</p>

<p>The burglar of today is a vastly differently equipped individual
from the one of a generation ago. He must of necessity
be an enterprising and daring man, and in addition to
that if he would make a success of safe cracking in this
twentieth century he must be something of a scientist as well.
The great progress made in the manufacture of safes for
the storage of valuables has brought about this revolution in
the burglar's methods, and it is a regrettable fact to note that
no matter how strong and secure safes may be made, the ingenuity
of the scientific burglar is pretty sure to devise some
method to overcome their security.</p>

<p>The most recent development in the burglar's advancement
is the use of electricity to open safes in place of the old-time
jimmy and the more recent dynamite.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Old-Time Strong Box.</span></h4>

<p>Years ago the old-fashioned strong box was considered quite
an adequate protection for hoarded wealth and was the legitimate
successor of the stocking in which the gold pieces were
carefully stored and hidden away. The strong box of wood
bound with iron and with ponderous locks proved but child's
play for the burglar thoroughly intent upon obtaining its
contents. Then came the more modern iron and steel safe,
with its thick plates of highly tempered metal and ingeniously
complicated time locks.</p>

<p>Safe breakers have more than kept pace with improvement
in safes, including time locks, chilled steel chests of eight or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
nine inches thicknesses and electric protective attachments. Their
tools are made by some of the finest mechanics and inventive
geniuses of the world. A full kit of the most approved modern
safe workers' tools costs about $5,000.</p>

<p>The modern burglar is like love in one respect; he "laughs
at locksmiths." Yet he is not much of an artist, although he
is rapidly improving. The simple tools of the burglars' trade
indicate how easily the contrivances made to bar his progress
are overcome. Yet these tools give no mark of great mechanical
genius. They are as crude as the average burglar
is. They are in keeping with his practices of force and brutality.
The destructive power of the best pieces of handiwork is
their main advantage, and doubtless an illustration of the
house-breaker's stunted idea, that the best way to overcome
obstacles is in all cases to break them down.</p>

<p>The tools used by the burglar are supplied to him. They are
made by men after his own heart, and who make for him
what is most effective in his hands. No doubt there are smart
men engaged in the business of defying law and setting the
rights of honest people at naught. Some of the methods they
employ might be used to their credit in a commendable industry.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Jimmy Is Necessary.</span></h4>

<p>There are places where the jimmy is absolutely indispensable
to the burglar. Front doors, which a house proprietor usually
has doubly bolted and barred and supplied with improved
locks, are the last apertures in the world a night marauder
would seek to enter.</p>

<p>It must be an amusing thing to the burglar, after noting
the precautions taken to prevent his entrance by the street
door, when he has walked through the skylight on the roof
without the slightest resistance, or dropped through the coal-hole
leading to the cellar from the sidewalk, to find that no
doors bar his passage from there to the rooms above.</p>

<p>Those are the popular ways of getting into many banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and business houses. The basement door, at the rear, if there
is one, is another. In such case the jimmy is the magic wand
that opens the way. It is more useful to the burglar than any
half dozen of his other implements, and is the first thing he
purchases when getting an outfit.</p>

<p>How do safe burglars get their tools? Why, every man
of any account in that line has what he calls "his man,"
who is a practical mechanic, and makes everything in the
shape of jimmies, punches, etc., that the burglar uses.
A safe blower's outfit consists of many curious tools, some
of them being of special design for some particular class
of work of which the owner is the originator. Scarcely any
two men work alike, and some of the clever ones invent instruments
to do a certain part of their work. When a well-known
notorious crook was arrested several years ago in his
room, the officers found one of the finest kits of burglars' tools
that was ever brought into police headquarters. Talk about
ingenuity&mdash;if that man had applied but one-third of the intelligence
to a legitimate business that he had spent in devising
tools for robbery, he would have been a millionaire today.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago when burglars started out to rob a safe
they filled a carpet sack with highly tempered drills, copper
sledges, sectional jimmies, dark lanterns, powder and a fuse.
On the way they stole a horse and wagon, filling the latter
with the greater portion of the tools of a country blacksmith
shop. They would work on the safe from four to six hours,
and finally blow it open with a fine grade of ducking powder.
Usually the shock would break all the glass in the building,
arouse the town, and the burglars would often have to fight
for their lives. In those days the men had to be big and
powerful, because the work was extremely laborious. If the
burglar was an ex-prize fighter or noted tough, so much the
better, for he could make a desperate resistance in case he
was caught in the act, or immediately after it.</p>

<p>With the modern safe burglar it is almost totally different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Although much more skillful and successful than his predecessor,
he is more conservative. He seldom runs his own head
into danger, and therefore seldom endangers the head of a
law-abiding citizen by permitting his head to come into contact
with him or the job while it is under way. Every precaution
is taken against being surprised, and it is seldom the robbery
is discovered until the cashier's appearance the next morning.
The modern safe burglar is an exceedingly keen, intelligent
man. He can open a safe having all modern improvements in
from ten minutes to two hours without the aid of explosives
and by only slightly defacing the safe. Sometimes he leaves
scarcely a mark.</p>

<p>A first-class modern safe, whether large or small, generally
has double outside and inside doors, with a steel chest in the
bottom, forming really a safe within a safe, the inside being
the stronger. The outside door is usually either "stuffed" or
"skeleton." The inside one is made of eight or nine sheets, of
different temper, of the finest steel. These sheets are bolted
together with conical bolts having left-hand threads, after
which the heads of the bolts are cut off, leaving what is virtually
a solid piece of steel, which no drill can penetrate. The
best locks are of the combination type, with time lock attachment.
In many cities and town safes containing the valuables
have an electric alarm attached. Any tampering with it will
communicate the fact to the owners or the safe's guardian,
which in cities is either an electric protective bureau or a central
police station. A recent invention in France is a photographic
attachment. As soon as the safe is touched this device
will light an electric lamp, photograph the intruder and give
the alarm at the electric protective company's office. As a consequence
safe-breaking is going out of date in France, as the
cleverest criminals have so far failed to find a way to circumvent
the camera.</p>

<p>The first thing considered by a gang of the finest experts
is a desirable bank's location and the chances for getting safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
away with the plunder. Every transportation facility is carefully
considered. As the work is almost invariably done at
the season of the year when wagon roads are impassible, railroad
time tables are carefully considered. In these days of
the telegraph and telephone the gang must be under cover
in a large city or concealed with friends by the time the crime
is discovered, which, at the utmost, is about six hours after
the crime has been committed.</p>

<p>From November 1 to March 1 is the safe burglar's harvest
time, because then the nights are longest and the chances of
detection less, as fewer people are on the streets and houses
adjoining, being tightly closed to exclude the cold, exclude
noises also. A man can, furthermore, carry tools in an overcoat
without attracting attention, that he could not wear with
a summer suit. The remainder of the year is spent in "marking"
the most desirable banks for future operations. Four
men, who compose the ordinary safe mob, will put up from
thirty to forty "jobs" for a winter's work, allowing for all
contingencies. From six to ten of these will be carried out.
A bank safe will be broken into in a small town in Maine, and
in ten days the gang will be operating in Texas.</p>

<p>Having decided on a bank, the habits of the cashier and
other chief employees are carefully studied; but, above all, of
those who visit the bank after working hours, chief of whom
is the watchman, if the bank has one. If the watchman drinks,
or spends time visiting women when he should be at the bank,
the bank is an easy prey. Weeks, and sometimes even months,
are spent in putting up a job of magnitude, and a number
of smaller jobs are done to carry out one where the proceeds
may run into the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Men visit the town who have a legitimate business as a
"blind." They make all preliminary preparations. The greatest
ingenuity is employed to obtain exact information, such
as the evenings the cashier or teller is likely to visit the bank
and the exact time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Scientific Burglary.</span></h4>

<p>Burglars whose chief qualification is the mechanical ability
to open bank vaults and safes and steal thousands of dollars
in bonds or cash cannot be classed with those who break open
a store door and filch a lot of buckets, brooms or dry goods.</p>

<p>The man who makes the defects of a combination lock, safe
or vault a study must have intelligence and mechanical knowledge
equal to that of a man who draws a big salary for what
he knows. Whenever any new combination lock is brought
in the market for vault or safe use the scientific burglar obtains
one, and by patient study discovers its weakness or defect,
something which every safe or vault has.</p>

<p>The combination of a safe or vault has often been learned
by these burglars by obtaining an entrance to the banking
house after banking hours, removing the dial of the combination
and placing a sheet of tin foil behind it. Then, replacing
the dial, the turning of the combination in opening or closing
makes the impression of letters or numbers on the soft foil,
which is removed by the burglar at the first chance he has
to get into the banking house. Having the combination impressed
on the tin foil, he and his accomplices open the vault
or safe, secure the contents, and then often change or put out
of order the combination, so the doors of the vault or safe
cannot be opened for some hours after the regular time for
opening, and then only by an expert of that particular safe
company. This, of course, gives the thieves several hours of
valuable time in which to effect their escape.</p>

<p>The tools required by the mechanical burglar who forces
open safes are the air pump, putty, powder, fuse, sectional
jimmy, steel drills, diamond drills, copper sledges, steel-faced
sledges (leather covered), lamp and blow pipe, jack screw,
wedges, dynamite and syringe, brace with box slide, feed screw
drills, steel punches, small bellows, blank steel keys, skeleton
keys, nippers, dark lantern, twine and screw eyes. The latest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
most dangerous set of tools manufactured is the second power
in mechanics&mdash;the screw.</p>

<p>The method of work with the screw is to first rig a brace,
and then drill a hole in the safe, cut a thread in the hole and
then insert a female screw. Then, with a long steel screw
with a handle so long that two men can turn it, the screw is
inserted in the female screw, and by turning it goes in until it
strikes the back of the safe. Then either the back or the front
must give way. In nearly all cases it is the latter, as that is
the weakest, and it gives enough to insert the sectional jimmy,
which the screw handle is part of. The jimmy is then inserted
in the part forced out, and the safe is then torn asunder
and its contents easily appropriated. This work is accomplished
without much noise.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Invent New Devices.</span></h4>

<p>However, these new one-piece safes have not discouraged the
malefactors. They have only suggested to them the creation
of special appliances which enable them, without stopping to
pick the lock, to remove from the side wall of the safe a
circle of the metal large enough to allow of an arm to be put
inside.</p>

<p>One of the most important of these new devices for assisting
the safe-crackers in their crime is formed of an iron hoop
furnished with well-tempered steel teeth, which is fixed by
means of a simple pivot on the safe after a screw worm has
been previously driven in. The instrument is then turned
on its pivot and plows a groove in the safe wall each time it
revolves.</p>

<p>Science has not left the burglar weaponless, however. The
progress accomplished has merely compelled him to obtain
higher qualifications, and in the continuous strife between the
armor plate and the desperado who would pierce it the thieves
have had hitherto the last word. For many years dynamite
was their chief reliance, and then a product was discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
some years ago by a chemist, who gave it the name of "thermit,"
by which the cracksman was able to melt sheet metal, inches
thick, with comparatively little trouble.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Melts Hardest Steel.</span></h4>

<p>This substance known as "thermit" is in current use for
repairing, heating or soldering large pieces of metal and consists
of a mixture of aluminum and oxide of iron, the latter
being replaced, according to the requirement, by oxide of lead,
peroxide of sodium or peroxide of barium. This composition
is thoroughly mixed together, or is used in the form of cartridges
or tablets, which ignite by means of a piece of magnesium
fixed in the substance like a wick. The heat developed
is more than sufficient to cause the hardest steel to melt.</p>

<p>Although this process is rapid and silent and really marvelous
from the point of view of the result obtained, it is not
without much danger to those using it, for at the high temperature
produced by it an inexperienced operator runs the risk
of being seriously burned. In consequence the prudent and
careful burglar uses accessories which render him secure against
such accidents. He protects his eyes by means of heavy dark
glasses, wears shields of aluminum over his hands and applies
the mixture through a small hole in the bottom of a crucible.
When the reaction takes place it lasts long enough to allow
the operator to charge the crucible again and again in proportion
as the melting of the metal plate is effected, thus
making an opening of the desired size in the safe. It is a
simple enough operation for a skilled burglar, but a very dangerous
one for an amateur.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Tests with Electricity.</span></h4>

<p>But even this has been discounted by an experiment before
a United States government commission, showing that electricity
can be so applied as to give the scientific cracksman a
greater field for operation than ever before. The experiment
was made by an expert burglar, who, having retired from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
business after amassing a sufficient competency, was requested
to favor the commission by contributing the light of his knowledge.</p>

<p>He demonstrated that by the aid of electricity he could,
within a short time, reduce safes of the highest repute to old
iron. For this purpose he took out of his pocket a style in the
form of retort carbon, similar to those used for arc lamps; a
few yards of electric wire, black eyeglasses and a plate pierced
in the middle. It was with this simple outfit he pierced in
less than three minutes a circle of holes in a cast steel safe
with walls one and a half inches thick.</p>

<p>His method of procedure was simplicity itself. To the
electric supply current of the chandelier overhead he connected
two wires, one of which he fixed on the safe, and the other at
the extreme of his carbon style. It was suitably insulated by
a wooden handle. Then, having inserted this pencil in the
hole of the plate, whose purpose was to protect him against
the heat and light, he produced a voltaic arc of immense power
between the point of his style and the wall of the safe, thus
melting the metal with the greatest ease.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Some Concrete Examples.</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Burglars Use Acetylene Flame to Open Safe Door.</span></h4>

<p>In Paris, January 4, 1908, burglars broke into the premises
of Martin and Baume, colonial traders, at Marseilles, and stole
money and goods to the value of $20,000. Most of their booty
they took from a safe, the door of which they burnt through
with an apparatus giving an acetylene flame of sufficient heat
to melt the metal.</p>

<p>The case recalls one at Antwerp recently, when the thieves
melted a safe with a combined oxygen and acetylene flame.</p>

<p>The police believe that the Marseilles burglars are past
masters of the art, and that probably not more than a dozen
possess such apparatus for melting safes. One or more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the burglars may probably have been employed at a motor
factory, where acetylene lamps are in frequent use.</p>

<p>In any case, even the finest lock or the best steel safe can't
resist, if burglars take to using oxygen and acetylene lamps
with blow-pipes. Safe manufacturers have a new problem to
solve.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Bank Sneak.</span></h4>

<p>The bank sneaks of the country were formerly among the
most troublesome criminals with whom the police had to deal.
The money and jewelry stolen by them aggregated hundreds
of thousands of dollars annually.</p>

<p>The bank sneak is the cleverest of crooks, and as bold and
daring as any of them. But modern police methods, the system
of exchanging Bertillon photographs, and the organization
of bankers' and jewelers' associations, together with perfect
burglar alarm equipment, have combined to put him out
of business, and his work nowadays is on a limited scale.</p>

<p>During the past ten years not more than five good bank
sneak games have been pulled off, while there has been a similar
reduction in the raids on jewelry shops.</p>

<p>The Bertillon photographs facilitate the identification of
the sneak and the bankers' and jewelers' organization put up
the money with which to pursue him remorselessly, and soon
catch him. Concerning the bank sneak and his mode of operating:</p>

<p>An expert professional bank "sneak" thief and his associates
study the habits of all employes to determine when
the greatest number are absent (which generally happens at
the noon hour), decide how many confederates will be necessary
to engage the attention of the remaining employes, while
the sneak thief noiselessly enters a vault, teller's cage, or goes
to a safe, and commits the robbery.</p>

<p>Confederates are usually of good appearance, understand
business methods, can discuss loans, mortgages, sale of securities,
etc., long enough to allow the "sneak" to operate without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
discovery. A "sneak" thief, wearing rubber-soled shoes,
will frequently pass within a few feet of the official or clerk
in charge, enter a vault or teller's cage, or rob a safe or money
drawer, without creating the slightest noise.</p>

<p>A ruse to make the way clear for the "sneak" is for a confederate
to drive in a carriage to the bank or store to be robbed,
as a pretext exhibiting a crutch, or accompanied by a female,
requesting some passer-by to ask the cashier or some other
official to step out to the carriage, which usually occurs when
few of the employes are in the place.</p>

<p>Another device is to hold a large blue print of some property
on which is pretended a loan is desirable, or a bundle of
maps offered for sale, in such position that the view of the
official being interviewed is obstructed, thereby covering the
"sneak" and giving him opportunity to operate.</p>

<p>Another more recent artifice is the telephone; the confederate
of the "sneak" at an appointed minute "calls up" the
bank and requests that the paying teller be sent to the 'phone,
and there detains him in conversation while the "sneak" thief
operates; confederates, as may be necessary, engaging the attention
of other employes.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Circus Day Brings a Harvest.</span></h4>

<p>Many sneak robberies were formerly committed in medium-sized
towns on circus days, while most of the employes were
at windows or doors watching the circus parade. This offered
"sneak" thieves the opportunity to enter the building by some
unguarded door or window, or having, prior to the parade,
concealed themselves in the bank or store, to commit the robbery
while the parade is passing, virtually behind the backs of
the employes.</p>

<p>A favorite scheme, especially in savings banks, is for one
thief to attract the attention of a customer who is counting
money, to have a bill purposely dropped in front of him on
the floor by the thief and, while he stoops down to pick it up,
believing it part of his money, another thief steals the then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> unprotected
money he, the customer, was counting. Often professional
"sneak" thieves have posed as bank clerks or porters,
wearing office coats or porter's uniforms and, when the opportunity
presents itself, committed robberies of considerable
magnitude.</p>

<p>Some of the old-time "sneaks" used specially made steel instruments
of various shapes to move packages of money from
one section of the teller's cage to a point nearer the teller's
window, so that it could be more readily extracted. This practice,
while the utmost caution is necessary to avoid suspicion,
has been quite successful.</p>

<p>At times thieves have used large satchels or dress-suit cases
to stand upon and, with a long wire hook, extracted money by
reaching over the wire screen surrounding a paying teller's
cage.</p>

<p>A method sometimes used to commit money drawer or "till"
robberies in stores is to select some innocent-appearing storekeeper,
usually a foreigner, whom one of the thieves wearing a
silk hat would approach, informing him that they had just made
a wager that the hat would not hold more than a gallon of molasses,
and requesting that the storekeeper measure a gallon
of molasses into the hat at their expense, to decide the wager.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Blinding Victim with Molasses.</span></h4>

<p>Seeing the prospect of a sale, even if the wager was a peculiar
one, the groceryman would concede to this request. The
hat being partly filled, one of the thieves would place it quickly
on the merchant's head, blinding him with the molasses, while
they stole the contents of the money drawer.</p>

<p>The "sneak" who commits the robbery, to be successful,
usually is of small stature, active, alert and noiseless, as upon
him mainly depends the success or failure of the venture. He
must judge from the operations of his associates when the opportunity
to commit the robbery has arrived. There are no
signals or conversations between the confederates and the
"sneak" designating the moment for him to act. He must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
decide this from observation of what his confederates have
accomplished in preparing a safe way for him. If there is a
suspicion or a discovery by employes, it devolves upon his confederates
to do their utmost to confuse and obstruct the pursuers.</p>

<p>I once asked an old-time professional "sneak" thief how he
was first introduced into a band of first-class bank "sneaks."
He explained that he was raised in a small village having a
general store presided over by a widow; that she at times would
go to the cellar for certain merchandise, leaving the store unguarded.
This suggested to him how easy it would be to rob
the money drawer during her absence in the cellar, which he
afterward did, and which was his first successful "sneak" robbery.
Afterward he stole from a small window in the same
store, packages of chewing tobacco, pipes, etc., also occasionally
again robbing a bakery of pies and cakes, and occasionally
again robbing the "till." But one afternoon, before a
Fourth of July, in attempting to steal some packages of fire-crackers
and some loose torpedoes, a couple of the torpedoes
dropped to the floor, causing an explosion and resulting in his
discovery and arrest and final imprisonment. In jail he met
with other criminals, and finally became one of them, joining
with the first-class "sneak" band of professional criminals.
This man for years was a most successful leader of "sneak"
thieves, stealing fortunes, finally dying in prison and leaving a
family in actual want.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rarely Use Pistols.</span></h4>

<p>Among the old-timers were some of the most remarkable
criminals operating in any part of the world; their thefts requiring,
in almost every instance, dexterity and great presence
of mind, a quick eye and unflinching courage, yet few of these
"sneaks" used firearms or weapons of any kind in the commission
of their crimes.</p>

<p>Among the younger element appear the names of the cleverest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
thieves of today, some of whom have operated extensively
in this country and abroad.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Lord Bond Robbery.</span></h4>

<p>One of the largest "sneak" robberies ever committed in the
United States occurred late in the sixties, and has always been
referred to as the "Lord bond robbery." Lord was a wealthy
man, and had an office at 22 Broad street, New York City.
He had invested $1,200,000 in 7-30 United States bonds, all
being coupon bonds, payable to bearer, which any one with a
knowledge of finance could easily dispose of at this time. A
band of "sneak" thieves, consisting of "Hod" Ennis, Charlie
Ross, Jimmie Griffin and "Piano" Charlie Bullard, planned to
steal these bonds.</p>

<p>Awaiting their opportunity until a morning arrived when
Mr. Lord was absent from his office, they entered it when it
was in charge of only two clerks.</p>

<p>Bullard and Ross engaged these clerks in conversation, while
Ennis "sneaked" into the vault, seized the tin box containing
the bonds, and walked out with it. While these thieves were
expert in their particular line, they did not fully understand
the negotiating of the bonds, and for this called in George
Bidwell, since renowned as the Bank of England forger, who
went to England and disposed of a large part of them. The
thieves were at the time suspected, and Ennis fled to Canada,
but was subsequently extradited to the United States and convicted
of a crime committed some time before. He was sentenced
to a long term of imprisonment. Charlie Bullard settled
in Paris, but afterward returned to the United States, and
with Adam Worth, successfully committed the Boylston Bank
robbery, after which both returned to Paris and opened the
celebrated American bar under the Grand Hotel, 2 Rue Scribe,
which flourished for many years. Bullard afterward was arrested
for an attempted bank burglary in Belgium, and was sentenced
to prison for a long term. Bullard, Ross, Ennis and
Worth all stole millions of dollars in their day and died poor.</p>

</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">One Man's Bold Operations.</span></h4>

<p>Another celebrated robbery was on January 7, 1878, of
$500,000 in bonds and securities from the office of James H.
Young, a banker and broker at 44 Nassau street, New York
City, by "sneak" thieves headed by "Rufe" Minor, alias "Little
Rufe," exceptionally clever in his line, and who had with him
George Carson, Horace Hovan and "Billy" Marr. They were
located at Petersburg, Va., on March 23, 1878, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
all of the stolen property in Minor's trunk. Minor was a
Brooklyn-raised boy, small of stature, of good appearance and
engaging manners, a most expert "sneak" leader, and was in
his lifetime concerned in many great "sneak" robberies, among
them being: $80,000 from the Commercial National Bank,
Cleveland, Ohio, 1881; $12,000 in bonds from the Bank of
Baltimore, Md.; $114,000 in bonds from the Erie County Savings
Bank, in 1882; $73,000 from the Middletown Bank, Middletown,
Conn.; $32,000 from the Detroit Bank, Detroit,
Mich.; $70,000 from the Boston Safe Deposit Co., and $71,000
from the Guarantee Safe &amp; Safety Deposit Co.'s vaults, Philadelphia,
Pa.</p>

<p>In Chicago, many years ago, a band of professional bank
"sneaks" planned to rob the Subtreasury, then located in the
Arcade Court. Philip A. Hoyne, a leading republican politician
in those days, had an office in this building. He was
also a candidate on the republican ticket for some local office.
At a ball game "Joe" Parrish, a professional pickpocket and
bank sneak, picked the pocket of a clerk. Among other articles
found in the pocketbook was a key and the personal card of
the clerk, which showed he was employed in the Subtreasury.</p>

<p>Parrish imparted this information to Walter Brown, Sam
Perry, Little Joe McCluskey and Jimmy Carroll, all members
of a noted bank "sneak" band, then operating.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Hire a Band to Help Them.</span></h4>

<p>After several visits to the Arcade Court and trying the key
in different doors, it was finally found to open a rear door to
the Subtreasury office. On the day the robbery was planned to
be committed, the thieves hired a brass band to play in the
Arcade Court as a serenade to Candidate Hoyne, the plan of
the thieves being to start cheering for Mr. Hoyne, expecting
that the band and the cheering would attract the attention of
the Subtreasury clerks from their desks to the windows, giving
Little Joe McCluskey, the "sneak," an opportunity of using
the key to the bank entrance, passing into the office at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
back of the clerks and stealing as much money as he could
carry. About the time the plans of the thieves were completed
Mr. Pinkerton learned of them, and communicated with Elmer
Washburn, then chief of the United States Secret Service at
Washington.</p>

<p>On the day the robbery was to occur the band appeared as
arranged, the Arcade soon filled with people, and there was
prolonged cheering for Mr. Hoyne. Not one clerk left his
desk, and when McCluskey tried to open the door with the key
he found it would not fit. Through precautions taken by Mr.
Washburn, the lock had been changed and instructions given
to all clerks to remain at their desks when the band played,
which prevented what would have been a very heavy loss to
the government. Owing to the way the information had been
obtained, and not wishing to expose the source, no arrests were
made.</p>

<p>Walter Sheridan, known under many aliases, an accomplished
"sneak" thief, was a Southerner by birth and of gentlemanly,
dignified appearance. In addition to being a sneak, he was
also a general all-round thief, counterfeiter and forger.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Importance of Being on Guard.</span></h4>

<p>One night in 1873, at Chicago, while Mr. Pinkerton was on
his way home, he recalls seeing Walter Sheridan, "Philly"
Pearson and Charlie Hicks on a street car. He followed them
to the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad station, where he saw them
purchase tickets for Springfield, Ill. The following day the
vault of the First National Bank of Springfield was robbed of
$35,000 by Pearson, while Sheridan engaged the attention of
the bank officials, and Hicks remained on guard outside. Later
Hicks was arrested, taken to Springfield, convicted and sentenced
to eight years in Joliet prison. Pearson fled to Europe.
Later Sheridan was arrested at Toledo, O., for this robbery,
at which time Mr. Pinkerton identified him, and $22,000 of
the stolen money was recovered. Sheridan was mixed up in a
great many crimes, but in the last years of his life was looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
upon as being cleverer as a first class bank "sneak" than in
any other line, although he has been a successful leader of bands
of note counterfeiters.</p>

<p>"Billy" Coleman, undoubtedly one of the most expert
"sneaks" of modern times, who, between 1869 and 1904 was
arrested thirteen times, and who spent almost half of his lifetime
in prisons, is now serving in the Auburn, New York, state
prison, a four and one-half-year term for the theft of $30,000
worth of jewelry from a safe in the Clark Estate building at
Cooperstown. The stolen jewelry belonged to Mrs. Ambrose
Clark, a daughter-in-law of Mrs. Potter, wife of Bishop Potter.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Looked Like Coleman's Work.</span></h4>

<p>Mrs. Clark arrived at Cooperstown to spend the summer only
a few days before the robbery, and placed the jewelry in a safe
in the Clark Estate building for safety. Investigation showed
the thief had entered this building, which in many respects
resembles a bank, at the noon hour, when all the employes
were absent, opened the vault, the lock of which had been left
on the half-turn, taking therefrom a tin box, which he carried
to the cellar of the building and pried open with tools found
on the premises, taking therefrom all the jewelry and also valuable
papers. From descriptions of the thief we obtained from
witnesses who had seen him loitering in the vicinity of the
Estate office, and from the manner in which the robbery was
committed, we believed it bore the earmarks of Coleman's
work. Subsequent developments satisfied us that our conclusions
were correct, and we caused Coleman's arrest, two weeks
after the robbery, in New York, by Police Headquarters' detectives.</p>

<p>The tin box left by the thief in the cellar was covered with
blood. From this an incorrect inference was drawn, that
the thief had cut his hands with one of the instruments
used to open the box. A careful examination of Coleman showed
no cuts or bruises of any kind, on any part of his person, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
which blood would have flowed. The grand jury refused to indict
him for the crime.</p>

<p>On his release, knowing that Coleman had most mysterious
ways of hiding the proceeds of his robberies, he was placed
under surveillance, which continued for some time without result,
but eventually he was traced and found quite early one
morning, digging at the side of a building through the snow
into the ground, whereupon he was re-arrested and, in uncovering
the spot where he had been digging, most of the stolen
jewelry was found in an ordinary fruit jar, buried in the
ground about two feet.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Diamonds Buried in Jar.</span></h4>

<p>In the jar were found several settings from which some of
the diamonds were missing; sixty-nine of these were found in
Coleman's home, hidden in a small pasteboard box in the earth
at the bottom of a rubber plant jar, and one of the largest
diamonds removed from the ring was found sewn in a ready-made
four-in-hand necktie. After his second arrest Coleman
acknowledged committing the robbery, and explained that a
year previous he had made a tour through several New York
State counties to locate a bank which would not be difficult to
"sneak" in the daytime. He found the Clark Estate building
in Cooperstown, which he believed was a bank. He visited it at
that time, while the employes were absent, but did not obtain
anything, although he made a note of it as an easy place to
rob some time in the future.</p>

<p>When he did commit the robbery, and did not find any
money in sight, he picked up the tin box, little suspecting it
contained a fortune in valuable jewelry. When Coleman was
questioned about the blood stains on the tin box, he explained
that, as the day of the robbery was very hot, and he had to work
quick, in his great excitement his nose bled freely, covering
the tin box as it was found. Coleman has been a professional
bank "sneak" all his life, and in times past was renowned for
entering bank vaults and paying-tellers' cages in the day time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
without being observed. He never used firearms, and there is
no record of his having shed blood of anyone in the commission
of a crime. After all of his years of successful stealing,
he is again in Auburn (N. Y.) prison, without means.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Joe Killoran's Smooth Work.</span></h4>

<p>"Joe" Killoran, alias "Joe" Howard, a rather picturesque
type of criminal, came from good old New York stock, was a
rather brainy planner of bank robberies, and was usually the
one of a band to engage an employe in conversation while the
"sneak" committed the robbery. Killoran had the appearance
of a well-to-do business man, such as might negotiate a loan
from the bank, representing himself as from some firm of
brokers. He has frequently played the part of the sick man
seated in the carriage with a crutch, and not able to go into
the bank. He is notorious as escaping from the Ludlow Street
jail, July 4, 1895, with Harry Russell and Charles Allen, then
United States prisoners. He was in many "sneak" robberies in
the United States, and one which I especially recall was the
theft of $22,000 by him from the First National Bank, Plainfield,
N. J., on July 2, 1895. He was accompanied by George
Carson, "Sid" Yennie and Little Patsy Flannigan. Yennie,
Carson and Killoran held the attention of the employes while
Flannigan committed the robbery. After Killoran's escape
from Ludlow Street jail he fled to Europe, and, strangely
enough, met with an accident which necessitated the amputation
of one of his legs, which made him in reality carry a
crutch until those he operated with supplied him with a wooden
leg.</p>

<p>He was arrested about two years ago in New York City, decidedly
broken in health, and was sent to Illinois to serve a
term for robbing the government postoffice at Springfield.
After his release he returned to Europe, and was, in September,
1905, arrested at Vienna for stealing $100,000 from a depositor
in front of the paying teller's window in the bank in that city,
and was, on March 19, 1906, sentenced to six years in an Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
prison. It looks as though he had committed his last
robbery, and that this crime will cause him to end his days in
prison.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Hotel Sneak.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">The Use of False Keys.</span></h4>

<p>"Hod" Bacon is an illustration of the professional "sneak"
who confines his operations more particularly to the rooms of
hotel guests. He works systematically and prepares his plans
as the skilled detective works to capture the expert criminal.
This thief frequently would follow a victim thousands of miles
to commit a successful robbery. He would watch hotel guests
continuously for several days, until he observed them purchase
theater tickets or going out for the evening, first determining
how many (if a family) occupied the apartment, and how many
servants they had, and assuring himself before committing the
robbery they were all absent. He enters the rooms with false
keys, locks himself in, and works at his leisure; also unlocks,
with false keys, the trunks, bureau drawers, etc., abstracting from
them such valuables as he considers worth taking. He invariably
takes from the ladies' trunks some ladies' wearing
apparel, endeavoring to cast the suspicion that the theft was
committed by a chambermaid or other employes in the hotel
having access to the apartment. On one occasion Bacon robbed
a traveling jewelry salesman's trunk in a Chicago hotel. Not
satisfied with the valuable loot of jewelry he obtained, he stole
the salesman's overcoat, after which he secured sleeping car
passage from Chicago to Pittsburg via Pennsylvania railroad.
On the same evening's train, it so happened that the salesman
he robbed was then enroute east, and, peculiarly enough, had
been assigned a berth opposite the thief, in the same car.
After the train left Chicago, observing his stolen overcoat
hanging in the thief's section, he telegraphed to Pittsburg,
and on arrival of the train the thief was arrested, and identified
as "Hod" Bacon.</p>

<h3>FOUR ARE SENTENCED FOR LONG "GRAFT" RECORDS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>P. L. Tuohy, Philip Bulfer and L. E. Burnett Are Found
Guilty of Systematic Fraud by Means of "Fake" Contracts&mdash;Their
Clerk Is Fined $250&mdash;Many Poor People
Appear As Witnesses on Fraudulent Employment
Bureau Also Operated.</b></p>
</div>


<p>June 11, 1907, one of the most persistent and systematic
"confidence" gangs that ever operated in Chicago was broken
up for a few years at least, when Patrick L. Tuohy, Philip
Bulfer, L. E. Burnett, and J. C. Daubach were found guilty
of obtaining money under false pretenses by a jury in Judge
Ball's court.</p>

<p>These men were organizers and managers of the Chicago
Mercantile and Reporting Agency, with offices at 171 Washington
Street. It was a "fake" employment agency with a
side line of swindling by means of getting contracts on carbon
paper. Bulfer, Tuohy and Burnett were sentenced to the penitentiary,
while Daubach, who was only a clerk, was fined $250.
The sentence in prison is from one to five years.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Triumph for Wooldridge.</span></h4>

<p>The conviction was a triumph for Detective Clifton R.
Wooldridge who has followed the men for years. The raid
which resulted in the present trial was made by Wooldridge
and his men on February 11, 1906.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip Bulfer. Bulfer's pedigree from his home town is interesting.
Philip Bulfer was born and raised at Marshalltown,
Iowa. His parents live there and have for forty years. The
young man was educated, and when still a young man left
for Omaha, Neb. There he started in business with his brother,
and in a short course of time they were doing a good business,
but finally broke up in a dispute with his brother, resulting
in a "skin."</p>

<p>Later on he became a messenger for some express company,
operating on B. 7 M. in Nebraska, and he ran through the
State of Iowa for a good many years. He left that job or was
discharged.</p>

<p>He left there anyway and finally came to Chicago and married
a school teacher by the name of Mrs. Crary, from Goshen,
Ind. After marriage he moved to Chicago Heights and edited
a paper there for some time. Moved back to Chicago and became
a reporter on the Chicago Times, and finally started in
a loan shark business, loaning money at reduced rates and
making it a business to fight loan sharks, loaning money on
personal property, afterward going into court and enjoining
them.</p>

<p>He finally was arrested on many charges before Justice of
the Peace Fred E. Eldred, at Logan Square, on charges of
obtaining money by false pretenses, embezzlement, larceny and
on many other counts.</p>

<p>Was held to the grand jury and indicted in the case of
Detrich, which was finally nolle prossed before Judge Stein,
after making a settlement with Detrich, who promised not to
prosecute and was taken care of so he could not be compelled
to appear as a witness in the Criminal Court. This
occurred about 1897 or 1898.</p>

<p>He was also indicted one time for assault or attempt to
kill Oscar or Frank Arnold. Another compromise was made.
Many times he was arrested before different justices: Underwood,
Wolff, Hogland, Woods, Prindiville, Caverly and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
others. Cases were disposed of in some way. He was held
to the grand jury many times, and finally was arrested charged
with conspiracy to cheat and defraud a school teacher. Was
indicted and had an accomplice&mdash;Theodore D. Courtney.</p>

<p>He was convicted and sentenced for three years. Was taken
to the penitentiary and there served as bookkeeper and tally-man
for about five months. Later was released from the
penitentiary on a writ of habeas corpus by Judge Farlin Q.
Ball. Was taken to the county jail, his case being continued
from time to time, meanwhile was obliged to remain in jail
for about a year. Arrangements were made that if he gave
evidence to indict John W. Ronksley, Thomas D. Courtney and
Isaac A. Hartman, the State's Attorney's office would in some
way be lenient with him, and this he did. He gave evidence
that caused the indictment of the aforesaid persons.</p>

<p>They were afterwards placed on trial. Ronksley was fined
$100 and sentenced to six months in the county jail by Judge
Horton.</p>

<p>Hartman was indicted several times in the same proceeding
and placed on trial before Judge Horton and was acquitted.
Many indictments against Bulfer have been nolle
prossed, due to a settlement of some kind.</p>

<p>The records will show that they have been nolle prossed.
The Detrich case will show dismissal for want of prosecution,
but it was really on account of settlement having been made.
After these defendants were convicted he was released without
ever having a hearing on the habeas corpus matter and gained
his liberty on account of the state losing jurisdiction. Since
organizing the Landlords' Protective Association he was arrested
on complaint of A. D. Smeyer before either Caverly or
Prindiville at the Harrison Street Police Station and there
discharged on account of no prosecution. It was brought
about by a settlement.</p>

<p>The arrest was made on account of his taking $3 appearance
fee, which he should have paid and filed appearance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Circuit Court in the case of Chicago Press, R. D. Smeyers
vs. Barry Transportation Co. He was arrested a great many
times for obtaining money by false pretenses from poor and
ignorant people, who gave him $2 to get them a job, but he
failed to do so.</p>

<p>Patrick L. Tuohy was born in Ireland; came to Chicago
about forty years ago and located in Rogers Park.</p>

<p>He was a member of the School Board at one time. He is
a politician. He is a professional bondsman and is manager
of the Chicago Mercantile &amp; Reporting Agency, also an employment
and collection agency and professional bond agency
at 171 Washington street. They take a fee of from $2 to $3
and agree to get employment, but few are ever employed. This
money is put into his pocket.</p>

<p>He has been engaged in many questionable concerns. Among
them he and his pals secured a charter for the United States
Express Company and tried to shake down the company and
prohibit them from doing business in the State of Illinois.
The matter was taken into court and a Federal injunction
issued against them.</p>

<p>They have a habit of looking up firms, for instance, say
the Blackenberg Express Company, and get someone to do
business with them, then they will go in and see if they
use a corporate title and force them to settle in some way.</p>

<p>Bulfer and Tuohy were proprietors of the Chicago Mercantile
&amp; Reporting Agency: Daubach was a clerk in the office
and Burnett was a solicitor for the company.</p>

<p>Bulfer was the apparent head of the concern&mdash;in fact the
brains and dominating spirit.</p>

<p>Tuohy's name appeared as manager on the letterheads of
the company and he was plaintiff in all suits brought upon
alleged contracts.</p>

<p>Burnett, as solicitor, called upon small merchants and solicited
accounts for collection upon representation that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Chicago Mercantile &amp; Reporting Agency would deduct 25 per
cent in case of collection.</p>

<p>If a merchant gave Burnett some bills to collect he (Burnett)
would ask the merchant to sign his name on a piece of
paper giving authority to the Chicago Mercantile &amp; Reporting
Agency to collect. Or if a merchant upon whom Burnett
called would say he had no bills, Burnett would secure his
signature upon representation that he must show his company
that he had called upon him and solicited.</p>

<p>Each witness with but one exception testified that no contract
was shown him and that he was not told by Burnett
that in signing his name he was putting it to a contract to
furnish the company with at least 25 valid claims during the
next thirty days following and to pay the company a fee of
$20.</p>

<p>Louis Perlman, the complainant-witness in the case tried,
testified that he gave Burnett a claim for $2 to collect and
at the solicitation of Burnett signed his name to a paper
giving authority (as explained by Burnett) to the company to
collect. Nothing was said to him about a contract, but at
the expiration of 30 days he received a letter from the Chicago
Mercantile &amp; Reporting Agency, signed P. L. Tuohy,
manager, that he was indebted to the company in the sum
of $20. Upon calling at their offices to ascertain the cause of
such indebtedness he was shown a contract signed by himself,
agreeing to furnish the company 25 claims and obligating
himself to pay $20 on that day. The victims were all men
and women of the poorer classes, mostly small shopkeepers,
and such tradesmen in the outlying districts.</p>

<p>Perlman said that was the first time he had ever seen the
contract, for when he signed his name at the request of
Burnett there was no printing in sight and nothing was said
about a contract. Although Perlman had given but one claim
to the agent of the company, and that for the sum of $2,
which had never been collected, he was threatened with suit by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Bulfer when he called at the office of the company, and finally
compromised by the payment of $5. No service had been rendered
him whatever and yet he was compelled to give up $5
to have the alleged contract canceled.</p>

<p>The state called about 17 witnesses, all of whom had similar
experiences to that of Perlman. Several testified that they
told Burnett they had no bills to give him, but at his request
signed their names so that the company could know how
many people he had called upon in the course of a day, and
yet each was notified at the expiration of 30 days that he or
she was indebted to the Chicago Mercantile &amp; Reporting
Agency in the sum of $20, and each was compelled to pay
from $5 to $12 to have the alleged contract canceled, although
no service had been rendered to any of them.</p>

<p>One witness testified that he had refused to compromise
and he was sued before a justice of the peace friendly to the
company and judgment was rendered against him for $20 and
costs, amounting in all to $20.50, for which no services were
performed and for which he got not the slightest return.</p>

<p>Daubach was merely a clerk in the office, but when a victim
called at the office in response to a letter signed by Tuohy,
Daubach would tell him the amount must be paid, although
the victim would declare to him no service had been rendered
to him and that he had no knowledge that he had signed a
contract. The victim would then ask to see Mr. Tuohy and
Daubach would take him to Bulfer's desk and say, "This is
Mr. Tuohy," and the victim would have to settle or submit to
a judgment on the alleged contract at the hands of the justice
of the peace friendly to the company.</p>

<p>Although the indictment charged a conspiracy to obtain the
signature of one Louis Perlman to a written instrument, the
state introduced evidence, and rightfully so, to show similar
acts of the conspirators.</p>

<p>It was demonstrated clearly, by the evidence that Bulfer was
the leading spirit of the conspiracy; that Tuohy's name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> appeared
on the letterheads as manager and all letters sent to
victims bore his signature; that Burnett got signatures by
means of false pretenses, for each witness claimed that the
"contract was covered up and they were shown just the part
of the paper on which was the space for signature; and Daubach
performed many acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Bulfer and Tuohy did not go upon the witness stand. Burnett
testified that he always showed the full contract to prospective
clients, but was not called upon to explain its contents;
he testified further that he received from the Chicago
Mercantile &amp; Reporting Agency $2.50 for each contract he
brought in and he secured as high as six a day.</p>

<p>Daubach testified that when the objectors came into the
office and complained he would tell them they could compromise
and get off cheaper and admitted turning them over
to Bulfer when they asked for Tuohy.</p>

<p>So that it appeared conclusively that each in his turn performed
some act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>The case was called for trial on the 6th of May, 1907, and
was concluded on the 8th of May, 1907. The jury returned a
verdict of guilty as to each and fixed the punishment of
Bulfer, Tuohy and Burnett at imprisonment in the penitentiary,
and fixed the punishment of Daubach at a fine of $250.</p>

<h2><a id="PANEL_HOUSE_THIEVES">PANEL HOUSE THIEVES.</a></h2>


<p>Among the many dangerous and curious characters who live
by their wits in a great city none is more interesting to the
outsider than the blackmailer. To the reader of sensational
literature the ideal is a person who holds some great family
secret which he turns into money at rapidly narrowing intervals.
Although this character is generally overdrawn, no one
familiar with city life pretends to doubt his existence. The
blackmailer is a well known character in all large cities, and
certainly the arch swindler of the day.</p>

<p>Blackmailers are ever on the alert to learn anything detrimental
to a person's character, and let them once obtain this,
they fatten on it. Men's passions are taken advantage of by
that particular class of thieves known as "badgers," and their
operations are very rarely followed by exposure or punishment.
A pretty woman is the bait used by these thoughtful rascals,
who know full well that where a hundred men will resist a
burglar, scarcely one will resist a robbery where disgraceful
publicity must surely follow.</p>

<p>Briefly the mode of procedure is as follows: A house is
rented in a quiet side street, not far from the principal thoroughfare.
One man, occasionally two men, run the house&mdash;that
is, they do the actual stealing, while they have from three and
often as high as a dozen women out on the street picking up
the victims.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Must Have Pretty Woman.</span></h3>

<p>The qualifications necessary for the woman to have is to be
pretty, plump, wear good clothes, and understand the art of
making herself attractive. It is an understood thing that she
shares one-third the proceeds of the robbery. The house is
arranged especially for the purpose. The rooms on each floor
are fixed so that the door separating them has the panels cut out
and put in again on hinges, and fastened with a small button
not noticeable. The hinges are well oiled, and a small hole is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
bored through the door, so that the thief can see into the room,
or hear any slight signal given by the woman. The house
rented has a front and rear entrance, the latter for the thief
or thieves, who always station themselves on a corner of the
street near the house, by which the woman will always bring
the victim, so her pal can see him.</p>

<p>The woman goes out in the evening past the principal hotels
and through the principal streets, never speaking to a man, but
if she notices one who looks like a stranger and well-to-do, she
will give him a coquettish glance and pass on, looking sideways
to see if she is followed. If so, she will continue slowly, turning
the first quiet street, until the man who follows her has a
chance to overtake her. The chances are ten to one that he
will address her. She will appear shy at first, and not inclined
to speak, but after a short time she will talk, and after
some conversation she will convey the idea to the man that
she is a married woman; that her husband is out of town
and no one is at home. If he will be discreet he may accompany
her home, she says, and have a talk. The pair then
walk to the house, passing the corner where the male accomplice
is lying in wait, and the woman, pulling out her latch-key,
will open the door; and the fly is in the parlor of the
spider.</p>

<p>The male thief waits a few moments, and then makes his
way into the house through the rear. As soon as he enters
he takes off his shoes and in his stocking feet stations himself
in the adjoining room, and there bides his time. The woman
is all smiles and affection. She betrays an affected nervousness,
which makes her all the more attractive. She talks about
the sudden fancy she took to the gentleman who was weak
enough to be inveigled, and in a thousand and one ways manages
to give the idea that he is, above all others, the very man
she could love. All this time she is gradually disrobing, and
at the expiration of about ten minutes she is ready to do her
part in the robbery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Male Accomplices Get Busy.</span></h4>

<p>Meantime her male accomplice has put on his shoes. He
goes around to the front of the house, opens the front door
noisily, and, walking heavily, he knocks loudly at the room
door, and calls out, "Mary!" or any name that may suggest
itself. The woman will at once exclaim. "Oh, that is my husband!
Dress yourself quickly, and be ready to go out as soon
as I get him away from the room door."</p>

<p>The victim will hastily put on his clothes, and as soon as
the woman slips out and gives him the signal he escapes, only
too glad not to be caught. Before he goes, however, and while
he is talking to the woman, her pal has opened the panel, put
his hand in all the victim's pockets&mdash;(his clothes having been
put in front of the door), and nearly all his money is taken.
A portion is left, so that he may not immediately discover his
loss. Jewelry is never disturbed, as it would be missed at once.
The favorite methods is to take out the middle of a roll of
notes, if in a roll, or if in a pocket book, the bottom notes are
removed, so that when the victim examines his purse hurriedly
he will not discover that he has been robbed. If the amount
stolen is large the house is vacated, and the woman skips the
town for a time.</p>

<p>The women who work for these badger houses work in one
city for a time, then go to the next large city with a note to
the chief who runs the house there. The women generally
wear wigs, so in case the man reports his loss to the police he
will, perhaps, describe a fair-haired woman, when perhaps her
hair is black. A blonde wig is discarded, the case is fixed.</p>

<p>A female badger and her lover may be poor and unable to
rent a house. In this event they will rent a furnished room
in a furnished-room house. The bolt on the door is fixed by
simply taking out the screws from the nose of the bolt, and
the screw holes are enlarged. The screws are well greased and
then put back, the key taken out of the lock, so when the time
comes for the thief in go in, as previously described, he pushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
in the door easily and quietly, as the hinges are well oiled, and
the victim is robbed while he is making violent love to the supposed
"married woman."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Photographic Catch.</span></h4>

<p>Only a downright fool or egotist can become the victim of
this scheme. He deserves to lose whatever he has if he is
foolish enough to be taken in. The only way to protect yourselves
against the work of these thieves is to mind your own
business.</p>

<p>The new panel and blackmail swindle called the "Photographic
Catch" is one by which dupes are frightened into paying
hush-money, and otherwise putting themselves in the hands
of unscrupulous and designing people.</p>

<p>The old panel game has been brought up to date and is being
worked vigorously. This new swindle is one of the coolest
"bluffs" ever attempted to be worked upon an unsuspecting
person.</p>

<p>The victim selected by the coterie of choice spirits who work
this fraud is always a married man. The blackmailers learn
about his habits, and if his wife and family have removed to
the country they immediately set about landing him in their
net. If the family remains in town the swindlers spot their
man and wait until his wife and children go to the country or
seashore, leaving him to "work himself to death" in the bad,
wicked city.</p>

<p>The bait used is a handsome young woman. She soon finds
an opportunity to attract the attention of the victim, who is
always a business man, generally of middle age and wealthy, for
upon handsome but penniless clerks they do not waste a moment
of their time.</p>

<p>As soon as the intended victim has taken the bait he is enticed
to some luxuriously furnished apartment. It makes not
the slightest difference how long he may stay there, and it is
not even important what he may do there.</p>

<p>In the course of a day or two the victim is called upon at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
his place of business by a tall, well-dressed young man of gentlemanly
manners, but with much firmness. This is one of the
conspirators. He secures a private interview with his unsuspecting
victim, and as soon as the door is closed he proceeds to
outline his little game.</p>

<p>He pulls from his pocket an alleged instantaneous photograph
showing the victim in a compromising position, and for
the sake of appearances, make some broad hints about his outraged
feelings as a husband. It very soon develops that these
outraged feelings can be assuaged by the payment of money,
and the sum mentioned is always a large one.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Scare Money Out of Victim.</span></h4>

<p>The victim is thrown into a state of fright by threats of
exposure liberally made by the conspirators, and freely "gives
up" in order to put a stop to the matter. He gets a considerable
reduction upon the original sum demanded by paying
down the cash.</p>

<p>Now, while this game is nearly always successful, it requires
but a moment's reflection on the part of any intelligent man to
see that it is a swindle, pure and simple, the exposure of which
would put a stop to it. The payment of the money is compelled
by displaying a photograph, with threats of sending it to the
victim's wife.</p>

<p>Anybody who knows anything about photography will see
at once that such a photograph must be fraudulent. It is impossible
to take an instantaneous photograph in a room without
a flashlight. It is likewise impossible to photograph the interior
of a room lighted by gas without a very long exposure,
and generally extending over hours. No court of law would
place any reliance upon an alleged instantaneous photograph,
of the inside of a house professing to show people who were
unconscious that they were being photographed. If any such
picture were to be used as a means of establishing evidence in
court it is not unlikely that the person so producing it would get
into prison as an impudent impostor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>The photograph which is used by the gang working this new
panel game is, of course, a fraud made up by the conspirators.
It is an easy enough thing for them to secure a picture of the
interior of the room, showing another person. But in order to
get the victim into the picture it is necessary that a photograph
be taken of him elsewhere; probably in the street.</p>

<p>Then his features are pasted on the photograph of the room,
which is again placed before the camera and reproduced complete.
No matter how skillfully such piecing is done, it always
shows to the practiced eye, and any professional photographer
can detect the fraud.</p>

<p>With the guilty knowledge of such swindling in mind,
the conspirators who impudently produce such pictures can
easily be "turned down" by a brief explanation of their criminal
proceedings and a threat to turn them over to the police.
They confine their operations to gentlemen who have been indiscreet
and who can be easily frightened into paying money
to prevent a scandal.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Blackmail the Wife as Well.</span></h4>

<p>Blackmailing the wives of business men is carried on to quite
an extent, and it is astonishing how many of them will pay
blackmailers to hush up something that really amounts to nothing
if the game were exposed. If you refuse to pay blackmail,
that usually ends it. They want money, and when they fail to
get it, the matter drops.</p>

<p>The blackmailer operates on women in this manner: A man
has an accomplice, a woman who passes as, and probably is, his
wife. She is well educated, of refined appearance, and dresses
fashionably and well. The two work together. As the summer
season comes on the wives of business men, who cannot leave
business themselves, start for eastern resorts and watering
places, the woman blackmailer joins the exodus. She knows
the people who are wealthy, and these she spots. She watches
their every movement, and if the slightest indiscretion is committed
it does not escape her eye. She knows the names, business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
and homes of all the gentlemen they meet, and when and
where they meet them.</p>

<p>The season ended, the facts she has obtained are in the hands
of the male partner, and he studies them. Selecting his victim,
he arranges to meet her, as if by chance, usually in one of the
leading retail establishments of the city where she resides. He
approaches and addresses her with the greatest cordiality, expressing
surprise at the unexpected meeting. She is generally
surprised, and, of course, fails to recognize him. Then he uses
the name of one of the gentlemen she has met in the east, recalls
who introduced them, where the meeting occurred, and,
in fact, all about it. Then she recalls it, or thinks she does,
and it ends in her inviting him to call at her home. Here is
the web quite complete.</p>

<p>He calls, and, of course, when her husband is out, and may
repeat the call several times. Then he springs the trap. During
one of his visits a note arrives for the lady threatening disclosures
unless paid, say, $100. Even if innocent of any wrong,
the woman is alarmed and shows the blackmailer the note. He
appears greatly alarmed also, declares that he is a married man,
and that to have his visits known would ruin him. He argues
that the money would better be paid. He has only $40 about
him, but if the hostess will advance the balance of course she
shall lose nothing. She does it, and is thereafter in the power
of the blackmailer.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">"Bogus Detective" Game.</span></h4>

<p>A scamp, claiming to be a detective, often visits a reputable
business man, having gained knowledge of indiscretion early
in life. To hush it up they will demand from time to time
money, under threats of exposure, thus causing the person to
commit crime after crime to satisfy the heartless leech, who
never stops until his victim is ruined.</p>

<p>In a similar manner does the alleged detective blackmail a
man who has committed a crime and who has been imprisoned
for it. Upon his release the man may feel like reforming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> becoming
a good citizen if given the chance, but this the detective
will not permit, for as soon as he notices the ex-convict he will
say, "Look here, young fellow, you know my name and address,
and when I am in of an evening I want you to come and
see me or I'll have you run in." The fear of being "run in"
forces the man who has a desire to do right to steal to satisfy
the blackmailing demands of this corrupt class of people. If
the ex-convict obtains employment he is worked in a similar
manner, under threats of exposure to his employer, and so forced
to steal, and then the smart detective will exclaim, "There is
no reformation in that fellow; I knew he would steal. He
will never stop."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Storekeeper Scamps.</span></h4>

<p>One of the most contemptible of creatures is the storekeeper
who has caught some one (who has the appearance of having
money), stealing some trifling article, and will exclaim, "Here,
here! I have had stolen three hundred dollars' worth of goods
by some one, and if you will settle for all I have had stolen, I
will let up on you, and not prosecute."</p>

<p>These cowardly methods are simply mentioned to show to
what depths of meanness some men will descend, and are not
to be classed with the professional thief, with whom stealing is
a trade. As to how the female blackmailer can be foiled, the
remedy is obvious, and no man who possesses proper self-respect
will ever become a victim.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How Fake "Journalists" Work.</span></h4>

<p>The blackmailer first obtains some information about the
early life of the person he intends to approach, and there are
very few men who have not, in their youthful days, committed
some indiscretion which might be brought against them after
reaching maturer years. An escapade with a woman, or a
mischievous boyish prank which proved more serious than was
intended, are the usual indiscretions selected, and there can always
be found plenty of gossips who are only too willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
relate full particulars. The information thus obtained is written
up in a sensational style, and is taken to a cheap printing
office, where it is put in type for a trifling cost.</p>

<p>A slip, or what is known in a printing office as a "proof,"
is then printed, and armed with this the blackmailer pays a
visit to the person he intends to fleece. He represents himself
as being connected with a reputable newspaper, and says that
he has been sent to get the "other side of the story," at the
same time producing the slip on which is printed the startling
tale, which, if made public, would in all probability seriously
effect the social standing and the commercial integrity of the
intended victim. In the majority of cases the person approached
will at once inquire how much the newspaper would
pay for such an article, and the reply usually is, "From twenty
to twenty-five dollars." "Suppose I pay for the article instead
of the newspaper?" says the victim, "and I give you fifty dollars,
wouldn't that repay you for your trouble in writing the
article?" This is just what the blackmailer has been waiting for.
He hems and haws for awhile, so as not to appear too anxious,
or for the purpose of getting a higher bid, but the interview
usually winds up in his securing a sum of money to suppress
the information.</p>

<p>As he is leaving the house it may occur to the victim that as
long as the story is known to the editor of the paper there may
be a publication anyhow, and on this point he makes inquiry.
"Oh," says the blackmailer, "there will be no danger of that.
I will report that I have fully investigated the story, and that
there is not a word of truth in it, and, of course, they will not
dare to run the risk of being sued for heavy damages for printing
it."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Few "Beats" Among Reporters.</span></h4>

<p>There is no necessity for any man being victimized by the
"newspaper beat." In the first place, no reputable newspaper
ever puts a damaging story in type before every side of it has
been thoroughly investigated. The very fact of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> exhibiting
a "proof" is evidence that he is a fraud and has no
newspaper connection. It can be said with truth that the
repertorial profession of America has fewer "beats" in it than
any other profession or business that can be mentioned. The
majority of reporters are ambitious to gain higher positions,
and it is a rare thing to find a man regularly connected with
a newspaper descending to such trickery. If he is a genuine
reporter he will exhibit his credentials, and should he be assigned
to investigate a story that effects the standing of a respectable
citizen, and be offered a bribe, he would undoubtedly
publish that fact as an additional proof of the truth of what
he has written. The treatment for this kind of a blackmailer
is to kick him out of the house, and bid him do his worse.
Depend upon it, the "scandal" will never become public.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The New York Way.</span></h4>

<p>They watch some disreputable resort of the higher order until
they see some respectable looking man or woman coming out
of it. Suppose it is a woman, who may or may not have gone
there for an improper purpose. The blackmailer follows her
home, thus ascertaining her place of residence. The next day
he calls upon her. He puts on an air of deep solemnity.</p>

<p>"I am an agent," says he, "employed by a society to ascertain
the character of certain suspected houses. I saw you enter
one of them yesterday and know that you remained there more
than an hour. You know its character, and I shall, therefore,
subpoena you as a witness." Then he puts his hand in his inside
pocket, as if to get the subpoena.</p>

<p>Of course he hasn't any, but the woman usually faints about
this time, and on her recovering is usually willing to take the
jewels off her wrists and fingers, if she has no money, to buy
her immunity from the subpoena. Once she makes a payment
she is lost and has to continue it month after month, and year
after year, till some kind of a scandal breaks out and she finds,
with shame and sorrow, that her previous payments have only
put off the evil day.</p>

<p>We do not believe that many young men DELIBERATELY
take up the gambler's career. They drift into it through weakness,
temptation or accident. If any young man DOES imagine
that in the gambler's life he can find more money, less
work and more happiness than in honest living and honest
work, he is the victim of a dangerous delusion.</p>

<p>A most miserable creature is the gambler. He knows himself,
and therefore he hates himself.</p>

<p>No man can gamble and be honest, even with his friends,
even with his family. The idea of the gambler is to get from
another man what he has not earned from that man, giving
nothing in exchange. And when a man spends his time trying
to get away the money of others with no return he soon drifts
into throwing aside ALL honesty, even the gambler's brand.</p>

<p>The unsuccessful gambler is one of the worst of wrecks. He
runs his little course of dissipation, dishonesty, cheating and
swindling. He is over-matched and eliminated by the bigger,
keener, self-controlled gambler, who eats him up as the big
spider eats up the little spider. Hanging around saloons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
begging for a little money with which to bet, doing the dirty
work of the bigger gamblers&mdash;that is the fate of the little
gambling cast-off. He is not worth talking about.</p>

<div class="caption">THE FOOLISHLY HAPPY LIFE.
<div class="description">
<p><span class="smcap">Artist Palenske</span> herewith forcefully presents the lamentable
contrast of the man who delights to play poker when his boon
companions call, and his other self when the wife pitifully and
hopelessly pleads for money to meet household expenses. The "poker
fiend" will lose his week's wages in a night. Sometimes, to boot, he
loses money not his own, but he thinks it the part of the "game sport"
if he hides his misfortunes behind the mask of a smile. "Be a good
loser" is his never-failing motto. In the long run it is the neglected
wife and family that are the REAL LOSERS.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The gambler's life is simply the life of a criminal. And,
like every other successful criminal, the successful gambler
has got to work very hard. What the burglar gets, what the
pickpocket gets, what the gambler gets, is money painfully accumulated.
The successful burglar, or pickpocket, or gambler
must work hard and be forever on the alert. He must be
remorselessly cruel in taking money from those that cannot
stand the loss. He must be indifferent to all sense of decency,
for he knows that he is robbing women and children.</p>

<p>The criminal in ANY line, gambler or other, cannot be a
self-indulgent man if he is to be successful. The young man
who imagines that the gambler's life is a gay and easy one is
badly mistaken. If he tries it he will live to envy ANY honest
man who has a right to look other men in the face.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Why Gambling Makes Men Commit Crimes.</span></h4>

<p>The statistics of crime prove beyond all cavil that gambling
is the king's highway to fraud and theft. This is not merely
because it loosens general morality and in particular saps the
rationale of property, but because cheating is inseparably associated
with most actual modes of gambling. This does not
imply that most persons who bet are actually cheats or thieves;
but persons who continue to be cheated or robbed, half conscious
of the nature of the operations, are fitting themselves
for the other and more profitable part if they are thrown in
the way of acquiring a sufficient quantity of evil skill or opportunity.
The "honor" of a confirmed gambler, even in high
life, is known to be hollow commodity, and where there is
less to lose in social esteem even this slender substitute for
virtue is absent. What percentage of "men who bet" would
refuse to utilize a secret tip of a "scratched" favorite or the
contents of an illegally disclosed sporting telegram? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> barrier
between fraud and smartness does not exist for most of
them.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">No Basis for Livelihood.</span></h4>

<p>Serious investigation of the gambling process discloses the
fact that pure gambling does not afford any economic basis of
livelihood, save in a few cases where, as at the roulette table or
in a lottery, those who gamble know and willingly accept the
chances against them. And even in the case of the roulette
table the profits to the bank come largely from the advantage
which a large fund possesses in play against a smaller fund;
in the fluctuations of the game the smaller fund which plays
against the bank is more than likely at some point in the game
to be absorbed so as to disable the player from continuing his
play.</p>

<p>If a man with $5,000 were to play "pitch and toss" for $5
gold pieces with a number of men, each of whom carried only
$50, he must, if they played long enough, win all their money.
So, even where skill and fraud are absent, economic force is a
large factor in success.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Temptation to Embezzle.</span></h4>

<p>Since professional gambling in a stock broker, a croupier, a
bookmaker, or any other species involves some use of superior
knowledge, trickery, or force, which in its effect on the "chance"
amounts to "loading" the dice, the non-professional gambler
necessarily finds himself a loser on any long series of events.
These losses are found, in fact, to be a fruitful cause of crime,
especially among the men employed in business where sums
of money belonging to the firm are passing through their hands.
It is not difficult for a man who constantly has in his possession
considerable funds which he has collected for the employer to
persuade himself that a temporary use of these funds, which
otherwise lie idle, to help him over a brief emergency, is not
an act of real dishonesty. He is commonly right in his plea
that he had no direct intention to defraud his employer. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
expected to be able to replace the sum before its withdrawal
was discovered. But since legally a person must be presumed
to "intend" that which is a natural or reasonable result of
his action, an indirect intention to defraud must be ascribed
to him. He is aware that his act is criminal as well as illegal
in using the firm's money for any private purpose of his own.
But in understanding and assessing the quality of guilt involved
in such action, two circumstances which extenuate his
act, though not the gambling habit which has induced it, must
be taken into account. A poor man who frequently bets must
sooner or later be cleared out and unable, out of his own resources,
to meet his obligations. He is induced to yield to
the temptation the more readily for two reasons. First, there
is a genuine probability (not so large, however, as he thinks)
that he can replace the money before any "harm is done."
So long as he does replace it no harm appears to him to have
been done; the firm has lost nothing by his action.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How Commerce Condones Crime.</span></h4>

<p>This narrower circumstance of extenuation is supported by
a broader one. The whole theory of modern commercial enterprise
involves using other people's money, getting the advantage
of this use for one's self and paying to the owner as
little as one can.</p>

<p>A bank or a finance company is intrusted with sums of money
belonging to outsiders on condition that when required, or upon
agreed notice, they shall be repaid. Any intelligent clerk in
such a firm may be well aware that the profits of the firm are
earned by a doubly speculative use of this money which belongs
to other people; it is employed by the firm in speculative
investments which do not essentially differ from betting on the
turf, and the cash in hand or other available assets are kept
at a minimum on the speculative chance that depositors will
not seek to withdraw their money, as they are legally entitled
to do. In a firm which thus lives by speculating with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
people's money, is it surprising that a clerk should pursue what
seems to him substantially the same policy on a smaller scale?
It may doubtless be objected that a vital difference exists in the
two cases: the investor who puts his money into the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
a speculative company does so knowingly, and for some expected
profit; the clerk who speculates with the firm's money
does so secretly, and no possible gain to the firm balances the
chance of loss. But even to this objection it is possible to reply
that recent revelations of modern finance show that real knowledge
of the use to which money will be put cannot be imputed
to the investor in such companies, and that, though some gain
may possibly accrue to him, such gain is essentially subsidiary
to the prospects of the promoters and managers of these companies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 466px;">
<img src="images/img105.jpg" width="466" height="580" alt="(Group of gamblers commuting)" />
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Wherein Speculation Differs.</span></h4>

<p>It is true that these are not normal types of modern business;
they are commonly designated gambling companies, some
of them actually criminal in their methods. But they only
differ in degree, not in kind, from a large body of modern businesses,
whose operations are so highly speculative, their risks
so little understood by the investing public, and their profits
apportioned with so little regard to the body of shareholders,
as fairly to bring them under the same category. In a word,
secret gambling with other people's money, on the general line
of "heads I win, tails you lose," is so largely prevalent in
modern commerce as perceptibly to taint the whole commercial
atmosphere. Most of these larger gambling operations are
either not illegal or cannot easily be reached by law, whereas
the minor delinquencies of fraudulent clerks and other employes
are more easily detected and punished.</p>

<p>But living in an atmosphere where secret speculation with
other people's money is so rife, where deceit or force plays
so large a part in determining profitable coups, it is easy to
understand how an employe, whose conduct in most matters is
determined by imitation, falls into lax ways of regarding other
people's money and comes in an hour of emergency to "borrow"
the firm's money. This does not excuse his crime, but it does
throw light upon its natural history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">When it Will Cease.</span></h4>

<p>Publicity and education are, of course, the chief instruments
for converting illegitimate into legitimate speculation, for
changing commercial gambling into commercial foresight.
This intelligent movement toward a restoration of discernible
order and rationality in business processes, by eliminating
"chances" and placing the transfer of property and the earning
of industrial gains on a more rational foundation, must,
of course, go with other movements of social and industrial
reforms which aim simultaneously at the basis of reformation
of the economic environment. Every step which places the
attainment of property upon a sane rational basis, associating
it with proportionate personal productive effort, every step which
enables men and women to find orderly interests in work and
leisure by gaining opportunities to express themselves in art
or play under conditions which stimulate new human wants
and supply means of satisfying them, will make for the destruction
of gambling.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Gambling Don't Pay.</span></h4>

<p>Two-fifths of all the crimes committed every year are estimated
to be attributable to race tracks. Five men have been
convicted this year of stealing money from the United States
postoffice, and every one of them confessed he lost the money
at race tracks. The mania for gambling is growing stronger,
and as it grows the defenses of honesty crumble away.</p>

<p>What may be called gambling thieves are not so numerous
in Chicago as in some other cities, for the reason that no race
tracks are permitted to exist in Cook county. But there are
many gambling swindlers in this city. A large proportion of
the men in the county jail are there because gambling wrecked
morals in them, and hardly a week passes that does not find
at least one person before the courts charged with robbery because
money was wanted to bet.</p>

<p>This is not all of the injury that gambling does to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> community.
Because the state's attorney's office and the police
have not suppressed gambling the city is full of sharpers who
make their living out of men foolish enough to think that they
can get rich by betting on horse races, faro or roulette. These
sharpers are an organized band of law breakers, preying on
society, disorganizing it as far as is possible, their whole existence
a menace to decency and order.</p>

<p>The passion for gambling can probably never be eradicated
from human nature. But civilization should be able to prevent
rogues and rascals from profiting by it in the way usual
in Chicago. Professional gamblers&mdash;professional swindlers,
should be sent to the penitentiary and kept there. There
should be some means under the law to send all such to the
penitentiary and keep them there.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How to End Race-Track Gambling.</span></h4>

<p>Race-track gambling has unexpectedly become an issue of
importance in New York, and widespread discussion of means
to rid the city of its race tracks is taking place.</p>

<p>Discussion, however, is unnecessary. The way to end the
plague of betting on races is plain. Let the grand jury indict
officials of the Western Union Telegraph Company for complicity
in bookmaking and send them to jail. Without gambling
race tracks would be deserted. Without the aid of the
Western Union there would be no gambling worth mentioning.
Strike at the Western Union and the race tracks would
go out of existence.</p>

<p>The Western Union Company is the one great encourager of
gambling in this country. But for its reports of races, hundreds
of thousands of young men would be saved from ruin
every year. It is in partnership with sharpers who fleece the
foolish. It shares their gains in payment for the use of its
wires. The money that flows into its coffers from that source
is taken by trickery from the public. The race track swindlers
rob a man and hand over a part of their loot to the Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
Union, because without the Western Union's assistance they
could not have robbed him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 508px;">
<img src="images/img106.jpg" width="508" height="550" alt="Do they think about us at home? We air having such a
good time hear a lone." />
<div class="caption">Do they think about us at home? We air having such a
good time hear a lone.</div>
</div>

<p>But for the Western Union Telegraph Company not a single
race track would be in operation in the United States, for
without the Western Union's aid race tracks would not be
profitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>The way to stop race tracks gambling and drive race courses
out of existence is to compel the Western Union to observe the
law which forbids just such practices as those of which it is
guilty every day. That can be done only by sending a few
Western Union officials to jail and keeping them there until
their company concludes to dissolve partnership with crooks.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Public Lax; Gamblers Active.</span></h4>

<p>When the law declares against gambling, and advertisement
and sale of even "fair" gambling paraphernalia, why is it that
the righteous majority, which would not stoop to this form of
speculation, sits inertly by, allows crooked devices to be advertised
and sold, permits hundreds of men to waste their time and
substance, and dozens to blow out their brains as a consequence?</p>

<p>Why do "good" men prate on "personal liberty," which is
merely their way of washing their hands of the responsibility
for good government.</p>

<p>Does it eradicate the evil to say a man is a free moral agent
and need not lose his money gambling unless he wants to;
that "virtue is its own reward;" that "honesty is the best
policy," or that taking without giving return is a sin?</p>

<p>Would it not be better for this inactive majority of talkers
to elect incorruptible men who can do something besides talk&mdash;men
who would enforce the laws and provide heavy punishments
for concerns which make gambling machines in which
the unsuspecting have absolutely no chance to win?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Are We Following Rome to the Pit?</span></h4>

<p>Are we going the way of Greece and Rome? Is there a
menace in the rapid increase of wealth in the United States?
Are we allowing the moral tone of society to sink?</p>

<p>The present tendency is toward speculation, even from childhood.
In most cities the child barely able to walk can find slot
machines in candy stores and drug stores from which he is
made to believe he can get something for nothing. Is this the
proper training to give children? Is it right to get something
for which no return of money or labor is given? And is it right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
to thus lure children when adults know that their pennies more
than pay for what they get&mdash;premiums and all?</p>

<p>Children in school should be taught to calculate probabilities
as a part of their course in elementary arithmetic. Then they
would know better than to play slot machines or buy prize
packages. And when they grew up they would shun the bookmaker,
the lottery, and the roulette wheel.</p>

<p>The ordinary gambler speculates partly because he loves the
excitement and thrill of the game, but mainly, he will assure
you, as he assures himself, he is buoyed up by the hope of
winning. He does not stop to figure out his chances. If he
sees a hundred to one shot he will play it, seeing only that by
risking a dollar he has a chance to win a hundred. If he had
been taught in school to see that really the chances were 200
to 1 against him, and that he was betting a dollar against
fifty cents, he would keep his money in his pockets. Of course
the man who plays the races knows the odds of the book are
against him. He prides himself, however, that he is a wise
reader of the "dope sheet," and that can overcome the odds by
a superior cunning.</p>

<p>He knows that he can't win on his luck, for this "breaks
even" in the long run.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Fate's Cards Always Stacked.</span></h4>

<p>But the man who plays against a machine, if he has taken
the elementary course in the law of probabilities, can suffer
under no delusions and cannot give himself any reasonable
excuse. He is bound to lose. The odds on the machine are
against him. And even if they were not, it is entirely likely
that the machine would win. An old gambler contends that if
a man matched pennies all day every day for a month against
a purely mechanical device he would quit a heavy loser. The
only way he could keep even would be to start out with "heads"
or "tails," and then go away and leave the machine at work,
never changing his bet. If he remained to watch the operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
he would, be sure to lose his head and begin to "guess" against
the relentless mechanism, and then he would lose.</p>

<p>In the ordinary coin-paying slot machine, the dial shows
alternate reds and blacks, interspersed here and there with
quarters, halves and, perhaps, $1. The player wins 5 cents
on the black, 20 cents on the quarter, 45 cents on the half,
and 95 cents on the dollar. The dials differ, but suppose
there are thirty reds, thirty blacks, ten quarters, five halves,
and one dollar. The chances are against you, then, on the red
or black, 46 to 30; on the quarter, 66 to 24; on the half, 71
to 24, and on the dollar, 75 to 19. Most players, it is said, prefer
the larger sums as a hazard in the coin machines, although the
probabilities against them are much greater. Again, they are
dazzled by the chance of winning a large sum at a small risk.
Really, they are betting their nickel against 3 cents on the
red or black, and against 2 cents or less on the larger sums.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Children Throw Away Money.</span></h4>

<p>If the children knew this they would not fool away their
money in the machines when they go for a boat ride on the
lake, and it is reasonable to suppose that grown men and women
would beware of them if they had learned to figure chances
when they were in school. In the penny machines in the cigar
stores the probabilities are harder to figure. You play a cent
in the machine, and if you get two pairs from a revolving
pack of cards, always exposing the faces of five, you win a
5-cent cigar. In most of the machines you must get "jacks
up or better" in order to win. Any poker player will bet you
a chip on any deal that you will not have as good as a pair of
trays, and the chances that you will have two pairs as good as
jacks up must be at least twenty to one.</p>

<p>Some of the machines consist of wheels of fortune which
revolve from the weight of the penny dropped in the slot. In
any event the child gets a penny's worth of goods, and there are
chances to get two or five cents' worth. Gum machines give an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
alleged cent's worth of gum, with a chance for a coupon, which
is good for a nickel's worth without extra charge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/img107.jpg" width="474" height="580" alt="(Men playing slot machine)" />
</div>

<p>How many steps is this apparently harmless form of amusement
removed from the deceptive slot machines in cigar stores?
And, in turn, how many steps are these cigar machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> removed
from those in the saloons? The boy who wins five cents
worth in the candy store will take cigarette tobacco or a cigar,
if the dealer be unprincipled. Next he tries for a cigar in a
cigar store, and then for a cigar in a saloon. If he is lucky
in the last named, he is asked to a friendly game of poker.
Beyond asking if it is a pleasure to either lose to or win from
a friend, and to express the opinion that even though the game
be perfectly square, and there be no rake-off, it still remains
true that the time lost, and money spent for drinks and cigars,
far outweigh in value any pleasure that may be experienced.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Confederates Used.</span></h4>

<p>Men who make a business of conducting and playing poker
games stop at nothing to get the money. The expenses of running
the place, and the free lunches, drinks and cigars dispensed
must be paid for by some one, and the proprietor is not
in business to lose money. The game in which there is no
rake-off cannot possibly be square, and where there is a rake-off
the odds against you are prohibitive, if you play fair. With
seven men in a game of "draw," three of whom are "house"
men, the amount which goes into the "kitty" nightly is usually
about equal to the losses of the other cheat who dares not be
found out.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Cheating Device in a Slot Machine.</span></h4>

<p>Ordinarily the owners and saloonkeepers divide the winnings
of all slot machines. In a fair machine the winnings
fall into the receptacle A. Most of the money gambled by
players found its way into this depository. It did not please
the owner of this machine to share his profits equally with
the saloonkeeper. The winning player was paid from the
nickels which lined a zig-zag chute ending at C. The owner
changed this scheme by inserting the secret bag B. Then he
cut a hole in the chute at D. and arranged a spring which
diverted one out of three nickels into B. As long as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
chute was empty below the point of entrance of A the nickels
kept on filling the zig-zag runway.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/img108.jpg" width="391" height="600" alt="Slot Machine Proves a Fraud." />
<div class="caption">Slot Machine Proves a Fraud.</div>
</div>

<p>When the machine was seized, in the box where all the
gains were supposed to be, $60.20 was found. These two
sums represented the total proceeds of a day.</p>

<p>Confederates, mirrors, words, signs and hold-outs are used.
A player dealing from a stacked deck will inform his confederate
how many cards to draw by uttering a sentence containing
that number of words. Men lounging behind a player will
"tip off" his hand. Cards are marked in a manner imperceptible
to the eye of the novice, and sometimes liquid refreshment
is spilled on the table in front of the dealer, so that his
opposite can read the reflections of the cards as they are dealt
face downward across the board. The last-named scheme is
used where the table has no covering.</p>

<p>There are many who believe that talks of crookedness at card
tables are only sermons by "goody-goodies," who know not
whereof they speak. Let the following advertisement, recently
sent broadcast over the country by a large concern located in
the business center of one of America's largest cities, refute
such claims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The circular also mentioned dozens of other crooked devices
at lesser prices, and contained illustrations showing how the
machines work. Can there be any doubt these are used when
concerns devote their entire time to manufacturing them and
can get such high prices?</p>

<p>The sleeve hold-out above mentioned, is made of a hair
cloth sideway, about the same size as a deck of cards, with its
narrow sides laid in fine, plaited folds, so that it will either lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
flat or expand. This is sewed in the sleeve of the coat or shirt
and reaches from the cuff to the elbow joint. One of the wide
sides is sewn or pasted to the cuff, both ends being open. At
the elbow a strap fits around the arm, to which is attached a
metal tube that reaches down to the near end of the sleeve,
with a pulley attached to the end. A short wide elastic is also
attached to the strap, and to the elastic is fastened a metal
clamp that holds the cards. A cord is attached to this clamp,
which runs down and over the pulley, then back to the elbow
through the metal tube, thence to the shoulder, through the
clothing to the body, thence down through the loop at the
heel, with a hook attached to the end. The cord passes through
a flexible tube from the elbow to the ankle. This tube will
bend easily, but will not flatten, and is attached to the clothing
with string ties to keep it in line with the body. Its use is
to prevent the cord from ticking or binding.</p>

<p>To work this hold out the hook at the end of the cord is
fastened to the loop of the shoe on the opposite foot. When
the feet are spread apart the act causes the cord to draw the
clamp referred to down through the sideway and to the near
end of the sleeve. Any cards that are in it will reach into
the palm of the hand, where they can be taken out or placed
back into the clamp. By drawing the feet together again the
cord relaxes, and the elastic will draw the clamp and the cards
it contains back up the slideway to its place near the elbow.
There are other similar hold-outs. Don't let them hold you up.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Marked Cards.</span></h4>

<p>Marked cards are known among gamblers as "Paper," and
are considered an article of utility in draw poker. The dealer,
should he be a second dealer, will deal second to himself instead
of reading the hand of his opponent's, thus giving
himself a pair, two pair, threes or whatever he wishes. Marked
cards are used by those who are not second dealers, as they are
often able to fill a hand by holding a card in the hand to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span> correspond
to the card on the top of the pack, and in any case
enabled to read opponent's hands and play accordingly. They
are perhaps the greatest advantage to a professional second
dealer, as by drawing a bob-tail card of any kind he can spoil
the chances of an honest player, however, skillful. People at
large are becoming aware of many of the schemes used in
swindling, but so fast as the public becomes acquainted with a
scheme, the shark invents something to take its place or practices
the old one until he has it so fine under his manipulation it
is hardly recognizable. A professional gambler is soon known.
Even if he is never detected cheating, he is given credit for it.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cards Marked With Finger Nails.</span></h4>

<p>This is a mark put on the cards during the progress of the
game, with finger nail or thumb nail. It is put on so that the
gambler may know just what his opponent holds. The ace
is marked with a straight line or mark in upper right hand
corner. The king, is a straight line about one-half inch long
in the center of the card. The queen is a straight line a half
inch longer than the king. The jack is a straight line about
the center of the card. The ten spot is designated by a straight
line or mark in the same position as the ace. The nine spot
is a slanting line in position of king. The eight is a
slanting line in position of queen. Seven is a slanting line in
position of jack. The six is denoted by a straight line in position
of ace, running across the card at right angles to the ace
mark. The five is same as six in position of king. The four is
the same as five and six in position of queen. The tray is same
mark in position of jack. Deuce is a cross below the jack sign.
The mark denoting the suit of the card is placed in the center
of the top of the card. Hearts are designated by a perpendicular
line at the center end of the card. Clubs are shown by a horizontal
line in the same position. Diamonds are shown by a
slanting line in the same position. And of course, as hearts,
clubs and diamonds are marked, a card without a mark would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
be a spade. This is one of the most dangerous tricks, as it is
done during the progress of the game, and unless some one
knows something about it, it would never be detected.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Double Discard.</span></h4>

<p>This is used by many of the gamblers, and is done through
the neglect of the players. The man doing this will always
draw three cards, no matter what he may hold in his hand.
It is done by placing the cards he wishes to keep on top of the
ones he wishes to discard, and laying them down beside him,
ostensibly discarding them. As he is given his three cards he
looks them over and has eight cards out of which to pick his
hand. Suppose in his original hand he held three diamonds
and a club; he places the three diamonds beside him and calls
for three cards, holding one diamond and the club in his hand.
When his cards are dealt him he has five cards out of which to
pick two diamonds. He selects two cards and discards three
cards; at the same time he picks up the three cards that he
discarded first. Very few are expert enough to this trick without
detection.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Check Signs.</span></h4>

<p>This is a set of signs made with the use of checks. In making
these signs a white check counts one, a piece of silver or a
colored check counts five; often when colored checks or silver
are not handy, matches are used instead. The count of checks
corresponds to the size of the cards. One colored check would
denote a pair of fives, or three fives, when used in a certain way,
which I will endeavor to explain fully. Of course, all these
different signs are used between two men, who are in league
with each other in order to cheat a game. The first sign in
this set is the sorting of cards, which means that the hand is
no good. Should this sign not be given, the partner will look
for the sign denoting what is held. When one man wishes to
show that he has a pair, he holds the check or cards in the
right hand, slightly to the left of his body. For instance, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
white cheek held in the right hand, nearly in front of the heart,
would denote that a pair of aces were held. Two checks, a pair
of deuces, and so on to eleven, which signifies jacks; twelve,
queens, and thirteen, kings. For two pair, the head pair is
shown, the checks being held squarely in front. For instance,
aces up would be shown by holding one white check up in front
of the body. For three of a kind, the same sign is used, merely
the check is held a little to the right of the body. Three colored
and one white would signify that a straight was held; four
colored and one white would signify that a flush was held; five
colored and one white check would signify that a full house was
held; six colored and one white would mean four of a kind;
two colored checks, together in the palm of the hand, means a
straight flush.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Uses to Which a Pack of Cards May be Put.</span></h4>

<p>A pack of cards may be used as a Bible, a prayer book, and
an almanac. As a Bible and prayer book, the ace should remind
you that there is one God; the deuce, of the Father and
Son; the tray, of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; the four,
of the four evangelists&mdash;Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; the
five of the five virgins, who had filled and trimmed their
lamps; the six, of the command to labor six days a week; the
seven, of the seventh day, which God blessed and hallowed;
the eight, of the eight righteous persons who were saved in the
ark, Noah, his wife and three sons and their wives; the nine,
of the nine lepers who were cleansed by our Savior and never
thanked Him for it; the ten, of the ten commandments; the
king, of the Great King Almighty: the queen, of Sheba, who
visited Solomon; Solomon was the wisest man living, and she
was as wise a woman as he was a man; the knave, of Judas
Iscariot, who betrayed our Savior.</p>

<p>As an almanac, count the spots, and you have three hundred
and sixty-five, the number of days in a year. Count the cards,
and you have fifty-two, the number of weeks in a year. Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the suits, and you have four, the number of weeks in a month.
Count the face cards, and you have twelve, the number of
months in a year. Count the tricks, and you have thirteen, and
you have the number of weeks in a quarter.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Bill Hand.</span></h4>

<p>You have often seen a lot of poker players playing with a
lot of checks stacked up in front of them and a few bills or
greenbacks spread out in front of them, between checks and
themselves. A player having his checks in this manner needs
watching, for it is easy to slide a full hand or four of a kind
under those bills whenever an opportunity occurs. Whenever
a good fat pot appears he can use this hand which he has
under the bills by simply putting his hand on top of the bills
and turning them over, which brings the good hand on top and
poor ones under the bills. He always makes a practice of laying
his cards down on the bills, and other players see it at
different times and will think nothing of it. The only way
to detect this is by missing the five cards out of the pack, and
one has to be a expert to miss five cards out of fifty-two without
counting them, and after playing a good hand in this way he
must get rid of the deal hand, which is under the bills, in
order to get ready to collect another hand for the next play. The
principal thing about this work is to do it at the right time and
with the right people.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Toothpick or Cigar Signs.</span></h4>

<p>A gambler will use a set of signs made with a cigar, pipe or
toothpick to show his partner what he holds in his hand. The
signs are as follows: The cigar, pipe or toothpick placed in
the left side of the mouth signifies a pair. On the right side
two pair; in the center of the month means threes. To signify
that a straight is held the cigar is moved up and down with
the fore finger. Working in the same manner with the first and
second finger denotes a flush. With the third finger denotes
a full house. With fourth finger means four of a kind. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
show the size of the hand the fingers are placed on the cigar,
pipe or toothpick in the following manner: Suppose a pair of
aces are held, the cigar is placed in the left hand corner of
the mouth and touched with the first finger of the right hand.
Aces up or three aces can be shown in the same way. The
first finger denoting aces, the second kings, the third queens
and the fourth jacks.</p>


<h3>GAMBLING DEVICE SWINDLE IN ARMY AND NAVY.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>Scope of Fraud World-Wide&mdash;Soldiers and Sailors Victims
of Contrivances.</b></p>

<p>On May 19, 1906, Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge, with ten
men, swooped down on: H. C. Evans, 125 South Clark street;
George De Shone, 462 North Clark street; Barr &amp; Co., E.
Manning Stockton, 56 Fifth avenue. The offices were raided
and sure-thing gambling devices valued at $5,000 seized and
destroyed. H. C. Evans was arrested and fined $200; George
De Shone was arrested and fined $100, and E. Manning Stockton
arrested and fined $25. Afterwards E. Manning Stockton
was indicted, arrested and gave bonds, which he forfeited and
then fled.</p>

<p>Disclosure of conditions which so seriously threatened the
discipline of the United States army and navy that the secretaries
of the two departments, and even President Roosevelt
himself, were called upon to aid in their suppression, were
made in the Harrison Street police court following this arrest.</p>

<p>It was charged that a coterie of Chicago men engaged in
making and selling these devices had formed a "trust," and
had for years robbed, swindled, and corrupted the enlisted men
of the army and navy through loaded dice, "hold-outs," magnetized
roulette wheels, and other crooked gambling apparatus.</p>

<p>The "crooked" gambling "trust" in Chicago spread over
the civilized world, had its clutches on nearly every United
States battleship, army post, and military prison; caused wholesale
desertions, and in general corrupted the entire defense of
the nation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Try to Corrupt School Boys.</span></h4>

<p>Besides the corruption of the army, these companies are
said to have aimed a blow at the foundation of the nation,
by offering, through a mail order plan, for six cents, loaded
dice to school boys, provided they sent the names of likely
gamblers among their playmates.</p>

<p>This plan had not reached its full growth when nipped.
But the disruption of the army and navy had been under way
for several years, and had reached such gigantic proportions
that the military service was in danger of complete disorganization.</p>

<p>Thousands of men were mulcted of their pay monthly.</p>

<p>Desertions followed these wholesale robberies. The War
Department could not find the specific trouble. Post commanders
and battleship commanders were instructed to investigate.</p>

<p>The army investigation, confirmed after the raid and arrests,
showed that the whole army had been honey-combed with corruption
by these companies. Express books and registered
mail return cards showed that most of the goods were sold to
soldiers and sailors.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Forts Infected by Evil.</span></h4>

<p>Fort Riley, Cavite, P. I., Manila, P. I., Honolulu, the Alaskan
army posts, Fort Leavenworth, Fort Reno, Fort Logan,
Columbus Barracks, Fort McPherson, were among the posts
where hundreds of dollars worth of equipment was sent, and
where thousands upon thousands of dollars a month was the
booty obtained by the Chicago trust on a commission basis.</p>

<p>Battleships in every squadron, the naval stations of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span> nation
all through the world, navy yards, and other points where
marines are stationed, have been loaded with the devices.</p>

<p>It was found, upon investigation, that "cappers" were selected
from the enlisted men. Agents, who ran the games on
commission, were also found. These men, dazzled by financial
prospects, deserted in droves.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Many Victims Suicides.</span></h4>

<p>The men who were fleeced and had their small pay taken
from them month after month, became reckless. Some ended
as suicides. Hundreds became unruly and were subjected to
guard-house sentences. They deserted in their despair. The
conditions in the navy were even worse. Scores of the battleship
crews would be in irons at a time.</p>

<p>To the honor of the service, it was found that no officers had
ever participated in the corrupting vocation. It was the rank
and file who "fell for it," as the gamblers said. They became
either tools or victims, to the extent, it was estimated, of 60
per cent.</p>


<h3>KING DEATH.</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">An Average of 200 Suicides a Year at Monte Carlo&mdash;Many
Bodies Are Secretly Thrown Into Sea by
Authorities of This, the World's Greatest
Gambling House.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, Nov. 20.&mdash;Three thousand known suicides and murders
have been committed in Monte Carlo in the space of
fifteen years. The known suicides average fully 200 a year,
and some weeks there have been as many as three a day. The
Casino authorities do everything to hush up scandals and news
of tragedies. A large force of plain-clothes men are engaged
to either prevent suicides or to hurry the body of the dead unfortunate
out of the way. It is estimated that more than one-half
of the tragedies of Monte Carlo are never heard of except
by the Casino staff. The corpse is rushed quietly to the morgue&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
secret morgue. Here it is kept some time to see whether
relatives or friends are going to interfere or kick up a row.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/img119.jpg" width="428" height="600" alt="THE END OF THE ROAD" />
<div class="caption">THE END OF THE ROAD</div>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Bodies Thrown in Ocean.</span></h4>

<p>Every once in a while a small steamer slips out of the harbor
at dead of night. Its cargo is secured at the secret morgue.
At sea the bodies are thrown overboard, duly weighted, without
toll of bell or muttered prayer. There are countless graves of
unknown dead in the Monte Carlo cemetery. But these are
only those whose death has become known to the public. The
Casino authorities have a special bureau, whose duties are to
relieve persons ruined at the tables. The ruined gambler can
get from this bureau enough money to take him to his home,
or to some spot far from Monaco. Few know of this, perhaps,
or there would not be so many deaths. The "dead-broke" gambler
is taken through many inner chambers and before stern-faced
men, to whom he has to tell his history in detail. He is
also confronted with the different croupiers, who testify as to
whether he really lost as much as he may claim.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Banish the Dead Broke.</span></h4>

<p>Then the wretched man has to sign a document banishing
himself forever from Monaco. His name and particulars are
written in the "black book," his photograph is taken and given
to the doorkeepers and other officials to study, and then the
man is taken to the railway station, a ticket bought, a few
dollars given him, and an official escorts him as far as the
frontier. Should he return it would not avail him. The
police would turn him back again into France or Italy. It is
related that an American who was "broke" and anxious to get
back to the United States heard of this feature of Monte Carlo.
He had not gambled there because he had no money, but he
managed to make his way to Monte Carlo and demanded to
see the authorities. He coolly asked for a steamer ticket to
New York. Inquiries revealed that he had only just arrived
in Monaco, and had never put a foot inside the Casino, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
despite this the authorities gave him a steerage ticket to New
York and saw him on his way.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Bonapartes Big Stockholders.</span></h4>

<p>There is also the case of an important Indian army officer
who went broke. The authorities gave him first-class passage
to Calcutta, and $250 expense money. He had lost several
thousands. As much as $2,500 has been paid out to a big loser
so that he could settle up his hotel bill and take himself and
family home. Should such money be paid back the Casino
might again welcome the man. The sums usually paid range
from $25 to $200, and an average of 1,000 people a year apply
for this relief. The profits of the Casino are immense. Last
year they were $7,500,000, an increase of $760,000 over the
previous year. Seventy per cent was paid to the shareholders.
The majority of the shares are held by the Blanc family, the
leading member of which is the Princess Marie Bonaparte,
whose father was Prince Roland Bonaparte, and mother the
daughter of M. Blanc, the founder of Monte Carlo. She is the
wealthiest princess in the world, and was lately married to
Prince George of Greece, who is an impecunious princeling and
needs the money.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prince Owns no Stock.</span></h4>

<p>The prince of Monaco has not a single share in the enterprise.
But he derives his entire income from the sum paid
him by the Gamblers' Company for the lease of Monaco. The
prince is of especial interest to Americans, because of his American
wife. She was Miss Alice Heine of New Orleans. When
she married the prince she was a widow, the Dowager Duchess
of Richelieu. The prince is a "divorced" man. He first married
Lady Mary, the daughter of the Duke of Hamilton and
Brandon, and a son and heir was born. But eleven years after
the marriage the pair were so unhappy that an appeal was
made to the pope. The Catholic church, of course, does not
recognize divorces, but the pope issued a special pronouncement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
declaring his 11-year-old marriage invalid, for the reason
that the Lady Mary's mother "over-persuaded her to marry."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Receives Enormous Income.</span></h4>

<p>The prince, in return for the gambling concession, has been
getting an annual income of a quarter of a million dollars and
all the expenses of running the State of Monaco, including the
maintenance of the army and the royal palace. He recently
granted a further contract to the "Monaco Sea-Bathing Company,"
or to give the gambling concerns the full title "La
Societé Anonyme des Bains de Mer et Cercle des Etrangers
à Monaco."</p>

<p>This concession now extends to 1947, and the annual income
of the prince has been raised $100,000. Every ten years
it will be raised an additional $50,000. In six years time the
Casino will also have to pay him a lump sum down of $3,000,000.
It is stated that the prince of Monaco is by no means in
favor of the Casino, and that he abhors the gambling and the
consequent scandal in his state, and that could he do so, he
would at once stop it. But in the old original contract it was
agreed that the concession should be extended to 1947, and the
prince is not rich enough to break this contract and pay the
indemnity which the law would quickly assess.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Gambling Kings Go Broke; Often Die in the Poorhouse.</span></h4>

<p>Some one has advanced the statement that every human
being is a gambler at heart. Yet for a man to go into the
business of establishing a card gambling house under modern
conditions is to attempt one of the riskiest businesses in the
world. Recently one of the most noted gaming-house keepers
in the country seems to have suggested a further anomaly in
the situation in his utterance in a court of record:</p>

<p>"When I conduct a house on a 10 per cent basis of profit it
is only a matter of time until my steady patron 'goes broke.'"</p>

<p>In the face of this statement, however, the innocent layman
may be still further at sea when it is recalled by old habitues
of the gaming table that nearly every gambling king of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
history has finished close to the poorhouse and the potter's
field! How is it possible that the gambler with the insidious,
certain 10 per cent which inevitably wrecks the man who goes
often enough to the green table almost invariably dies in poverty?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Must Have Fortune to Invest.</span></h4>

<p>Today it is the gambler king who at least has an ephemeral
show to gain fleeting riches. But in order that these riches
shall approach riches as they are measured in other businesses,
the man who opens the gambling house must have a fortune
for the investment. His outlawed business itself will make it
certain that he pays the maximum rental or the highest price
for the property which he chooses for occupancy. To sustain
this he will need to seek out the wealthy patron who not only
has money to lose, but who may have a certain influence which
may tend toward immunity for keeper and player alike. The
"establishment" will need to have the best cuisine and the
best cellars, with palatial furnishings and a retinue of servants
in full keeping.</p>

<p>And somewhere money will be necessary in blinding officials
to the existence of an institution which is visible to the merest
tyro in passing along the street.</p>

<p>A constitution of iron, the absence of a nervous system, the
discrimination of a King Solomon and the tact of a diplomat
are requisites for the successful gambling king. Considering
the qualification of the man for such a place and the final
ending of the gambling king's career, it might be a sociological
study worth while to determine where, on a more worthy bent,
such capacities in a man might land him.</p>

<p>In real life, however, it must be admitted that the gambler
king is looked upon in exaggerated light. Almost without exception
the big gambler is posing always. Conventionality
has demanded it of him. But for more than this, in order to
command the following which he desires, he must have a certain
social side which is not too prominent, but which with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
tact and judgment he may bring out on dress parade. To the
layman the gambler is the dark, sinister figure pictured in
melodrama. He bears the same relation to gambling that
Simon Legree bore to the institution of slavery of fifty years
ago.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Story of One Gambler King.</span></h4>

<p>One of the noted gamblers of his time in this country passed
from laboring on the docks into the prize ring. When his ring
work was ended the gambling house was an easy step onward
in illegitimate fields. On the docks his reputation was not
above a bit of "strong arm" work in separating a man from
the money which the dock walloper wanted. Naturally, under
the Queensberry rules, there were things in the ring which he
could not do in overcoming an antagonist, and he learned to
make concessions to fairness&mdash;which was education.</p>

<p>Opening a gambling house that was adapted to the wants
of a rich clientele, it was a necessity that he preserve this educational
regard for his patrons, and that he should add to it.
Soon he was in a position where it was imperative that his
reputation for fair dealing be kept intact. He became the
"gentleman gambler" whose "word" carried all the accepted
concomitants of his gentleman's business. In the course of
events he attained a high legislative office under the government.
But it may be said for those who knew the man as a
man, not one ever ceased to regard him at heart as the dock
walloper, with the inherent and unreconstructed disposition
to regard other men as legitimate prey. Had other conditions
and circumstances made a card sharp of him, he would have
held to the promptings of his nature.</p>

<p>In the conduct of a gambling house of the first class, the
gambling king needs for himself and for his patrons the assurance
of uninterrupted play. Men of money and position
will not go to a house where there is menace of a police raid.
The small gambler may subsidize the policeman on the beat
in which his house stands, but he cannot placate the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
Police Department. And even when it is thought that the
gambler king is impregnable in his castle someone may break
over the barriers and raid the place in the name of the law
and order.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>Within a few years New York has given to the world some
of the inside working of the gambling business. When Jerome
raided the place of places which had been considered immune,
the proprietor of the house was considered worth a million
dollars. Before the litigation was done and the fine paid the
gambler king was out $600,000, his "club-houses" were closed,
and he had been branded officially as a common gambler, pursued
in the courts for payment of lawyers' fees, which he
designated as outrageous and a "shrieking scandal." Yet this
man was of the type whose word had been declared as good
as his bond.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Dice, Faro and Roulette.</span></h4>

<p>Dice, faro and roulette are the principal games of the
gambling house and, considering these, the experienced player
will tell you that he is suspicious of a "petey" in the dice box,
a "high layout" in faro, and a "squeezed wheel" in roulette, in
just the proportion that the gambling house keeper has not
recognized that he cannot indulge them because of the fear of
detection. The gambler holds to the gambler's view of the
gambler&mdash;and it is not complimentary to the profession.</p>

<p>That the gentleman gambler is justified in his attitude toward
the gentleman player, too, has been shown in the New
York revelations. There one gentleman player, loser to the
extent of $300,000. compromised with the "bank" for 130
bills of $1,000 denomination. There a gentleman player who
had lost $69,000 to the bank tried to compromise on $20,000,
but was in a position where the bank could hold him. How
much the gambler king may loan and lose in the course of
a year scarcely can be approximated. The gambling debt is
"a debt of honor," and even in business not all such debts are
paid. Whether a borrowed debt or a debt of loss to the bank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
this honor is the security, unless in emergency the gambler king
discovers that he can blackmail with safety to his interests
as a whole.</p>

<p>In general, the gambler who is "on the square" operates on
a 10 per cent basis for his bank. In addition there is the
"unknown per cent" which is his at the end of the year. The
roulette wheel, for example, presents to the player just one
chance in thirty-seven of winning on a single play, while the
winning on that play is paid in the proportion of only
34 to 1.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">More Nerve to Win Than Lose.</span></h4>

<p>The one great characteristic in human nature on which the
gambler counts is the fact that it requires more nerve in a
man to win than is required of him to lose! It is startling for
the layman to be told that $5,000 in a night is a big winning
for a player, while $5,000 is only an ordinary loss in a big
establishment.</p>

<p>This fact is based on subtle psychology. There are two
types of players, one of which gambles when it is in a state
of elation and the other when in a state of depression. With
either of these types winning, it is a gambler's observation
that the man who will play until he has lost $25,000 when
luck hopelessly is against him cannot hold himself to the chair
after he is $5,000 winner.</p>

<p>Gamblers have made money&mdash;fortunes&mdash;in times past, only
to be buried in the potter's field. There are several reasons
assignable for this end. Extravagant living appeals to the
gambler, and when he has left his own special line of gaming
it does not appeal to him strongly as either pastime or means
for recouping his fortune. If he turns to gaming at all it is
likely to be in fields where he does not know the game. Sometimes
he goes to the Board of Trade&mdash;sometimes to the stock
market. Playing there he is without system and without
knowledge of conditions. He is likely to bull the grain market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
two days after the weather conditions have assured the
greatest grain crop in history.</p>

<p>Once a gambler, always a gambler, is his condition; and it
is only a matter of time until someone has a game which beats
him out.</p>

<h2><a id="A_HEARTLESS_FRAUD">A HEARTLESS FRAUD.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">SCHOOLS TO TEACH SHOW-CARD WRITING
CATCH MANY VICTIMS AMONG THE POOR GIRLS.</p>


<p>December 5, 1905, J. H. Bell, the proprietor of a SHOW-CARD
COLLEGE at 21 Quincy St., was arrested and the
place closed. Bell advertised for students to learn to write
show-cards and signs. He is said to charge $1 for a course
and to promise positions at large salaries as soon as the
course is completed.</p>

<p>After the course has been finished and the tuition paid
Bell is declared to have refused to give the graduates employment
on the ground that their work is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>A great many girls are attracted to the scheme, and sign
contracts to pay Bell for the instruction in the belief that
they will be benefited. Bell tells them that he has customers
who will purchase all the cards they can make. They are
to receive a few cents for each card as soon as they learn
the business, but they are required to pay a fine of 2 cents
for each card they spoil.</p>

<p>"They are set to work painting gold borders such as are seen
in the windows of the department stores, but the task is so
difficult that only a finished artist can do the work. Bell has
a woman accomplice who hustles into the office when it is
filled with women and girls and tells how she makes from $25
to $30 a week painting cards. Her talk encourages the girls
to keep on spoiling Bell's cards and increasing his income.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Swindler Jumps Bail.</span></h3>

<p>"When taken before the court, Bell made a hard fight for
freedom, but he was held to the Criminal Court on five charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
of obtaining money under false pretenses. Bonds were placed
at $300 in each case by Justice Prindiville.</p>

<p>"He was unable to do the work he was requiring the girls
to do, so when the grand jury saw through his scheme the five
indictments were promptly returned.</p>

<p>"J. H. Bell jumped his bail, fled to Minneapolis, where he
conducted the same business. Here he was again arrested,
fined and given so many hours to leave the city."</p>

<p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was the next place Bell opened his
Show-Card College. On the 28th of September, 1906, he
was again arrested for operating a confidence game and
fined $80.</p>

<p>He then went to St. Louis, Mo., and opened an office in
the Century Building, under the name of the Clark Institute.
Charges of swindling women who applied to learn card-writing
were made against him and he was arrested, but later released
through some technicalities set up in the warrant of his arrest;
also lack of evidence to support the charges made in the
warrant.</p>

<p>The newspapers published his swindling operations and on
this account Bell threatened to sue both the publishers and
the police officials.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge located him through an article which
appeared in the St. Louis paper, which gave a description of
his Show-Card College, which was being carried on there.</p>

<p>John M. Collins, General Superintendent of Police, sent
Bell's picture and his Bertillon system of measurements to
the Chief of Police in St. Louis, and requested him to make
the arrest. On the following day John M. Collins. Superintendent
of Police, Chicago. Illinois, received the following
letter from E. P. Creecy, Chief of Police, St. Louis, Mo.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="author">
St. Louis, Mo.,<br />
Dec. 22, 1906.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">John M. Collins, Esq.</span><br />
<span class="i2">Superintendent of Police,<br />
Chicago, Ill.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Replying to your letter of Dec. 21, relative to J. H. Bell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
wanted in your city for obtaining money by means of a confidence
game, will say that W. H. Clark, office 354 Century
Building, this city, was in the Court of Criminal Correction
this morning charged with larceny by trick, and a <em class="italic">nolle prosequi</em>
was entered by the prosecuting attorney. He answers the
description of Bell and is undoubtedly the same person, but I
would suggest that you send someone to identify him before
the arrest is made, as he is making a fight here on his case.
Clark is carrying on the same kind of business here as he did
in your city.</p>

<p class="author">
Very respectfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">E. P. Creecy</span>,<br />
Chief of Police.</p>
</div>

<p>Detective Harry Harris of Chicago was sent to St. Louis
to identify Bell, and swore that in his belief Clark was Bell.
The detective department wanted the case continued until
Friday, but Clark insisted upon immediate trial. Judge Sale
held that the detective had not been positive enough in his
identification.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge arrived on the scene as Bell was leaving
the court room after being discharged the second time
by the court. Detective Wooldridge seized Bell and turned
him over to a St. Louis police officer and filed a new affidavit
of positive identification that Clark was Bell.</p>

<p>His lawyer demanded an immediate trial, but Detective
Wooldridge secured a two-day continuance to bring witnesses
from Chicago to prove the identity of Bell. This so enraged
the attorney that he turned upon Wooldridge and informed
him that he would again free Bell and even offered to bet
$200.</p>

<p>He further stated that he had asked Governor Folk not to
grant requisition papers for his client. Detective Wooldridge
replied, "Do you remember Admiral George Dewey at Manila
Bay who told Captain Gridley to fire when he got ready?"</p>

<p>Wooldridge further told him he didn't care any more for
him than the dew that dropped on the jackass' mane. Wooldridge
told the attorney that Bell had defrauded over two
hundred working girls in Chicago, Illinois, and that the Cook
County grand jury had investigated the matter, and returned
five indictments against Bell, and the Honorable Charles S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
Deneen, Governor of the State of Illinois, had caused to be
issued requisition papers for the arrest and apprehension of
J. H. Bell, and he had made Detective Wooldridge a special
messenger to go to St. Louis, Mo., and bring Bell to Chicago
where he could be placed on trial to answer to the indictments
that had been brought against him.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge stated that he had come three hundred
miles to perform that mission and he intended that Bell
should return to Chicago with him.</p>

<p>The attorney replied "he hardly thought the Honorable
Governor Folk of Missouri would grant requisition papers on
Bell."</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge told the attorney that he came for J.
H. Bell and was fully determined to take him back to Illinois
to stand trial and that he would cross the bridges as he came
to them and burn them behind him. He told Bell's attorney
if the Honorable Governor Folk refused to grant the first
requisition papers, he would try on each of the other indictments
asking for requisition papers.</p>

<p>If this failed there was five forfeited bonds by which Bell
could be brought back to the State of Illinois on extradition
papers.</p>

<p>If all this failed he had made arrangements to have him
brought back by the strong arm of the United States Government,
through an Inspector of Mails and United States
Deputy Marshal for using the mails for fraudulent purposes.</p>

<p>Wooldridge called up John M. Collins, General Superintendent
of Police, Chicago, Ill., by the long distance telephone
and requested the second set of requisition papers, certified
copies of the five forfeited bonds, and that the bondsman be
sent to St. Louis at once, which was done.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes after he left Bell's angry attorney, Wooldridge
was aboard a Missouri Pacific fast train, bound for
Jefferson City, Mo., to see Honorable Jos. Folk and lay before
him the reason why requisition papers should be granted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Arriving at Jefferson City at 10 P. M., the following morning
(which was Sunday morning) he made a demand upon
Jailer Dawson for the body of Bell. Jailer Dawson referred
him to Judge Sale. Wooldridge found Judge Sale at his home,
who, after examining his papers, found them all right and
ordered the jailer to turn over Bell to Detective Clifton R.
Wooldridge.</p>

<p>Bell was again brought to the office of the Chief of Police
and confronted by Wooldridge and Harris who arrested him.</p>

<p>When J. H. Bell was arrested in Chicago December 5, 1905,
Mr. Turner defended him and afterwards went on Bell's bond
for $1,500. Bell was turned over to Wooldridge who slipped
a pair of handcuffs on him as he was boarding a street car,
landed him in East St. Louis, Ill., none too soon, as Bell's
attorney had sent out a writ of <em class="italic">habeas corpus</em> and would
watch all trains and stop the detective from taking Bell from
the State of Missouri.</p>

<p>Wooldridge requested the Chief of Detectives to inform
Bell's lawyer that both he and Bell were now in the State of
Illinois and their address would be in Chicago, Ill., if he
wished to see either of them.</p>

<p>One of the police officers at East St. Louis overheard Bell
tell his cell-mate he would make his escape before he reached
Chicago, and told him to watch the newspapers the next day.</p>

<p>This information was given to Wooldridge.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge had tickets over the Chicago and Eastern
Illinois Railroad.</p>

<p>This train left at 11 P. M. at night and the first stop it
made was twenty miles north on the Missouri side of the river.</p>

<p>Wooldridge could not take his prisoner and board the train
there on account of <em class="italic">habeas corpus</em> writs for Bell. Officers were
watching all trains expecting him to leave St. Louis. Wooldridge
outwitted them by taking interurban street car, traveling
some twenty-five miles in company with two officers whom
the Chief of Police had sent along with him. Upon arriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
at the station in a heavy rainstorm he found the agent
had deserted his post and gone home.</p>

<p>The headlight on the Eastern Illinois fast express train
showed up in the distance. What was to be done to bring
the train to a stop so that they could board it? At this important
moment Wooldridge's eye rested upon a switch lamp
under a switch only a few yards from him; with one leap
across the track he secured the lamp and began to swing it
across the track to and fro with a red light pointed towards
the approaching train. This was a signal for the engineer to
stop. But would the engineer see the signal in time, or would
the rain which was beating down in torrents prevent the engineer
from seeing the signal? It was an exciting few seconds
to pass through. But the engineer did see the signal to stop,
he blew one long blast of his whistle, reversed his engine,
applied the air-brakes which brought the train to a stand-still
right at the station door.</p>

<p>A conductor and brakeman had alighted and run forward on
the sudden stop of the train as they thought some accident had
happened, inquired of Wooldridge what was the trouble. He
replied, "Nothing but two passengers for Chicago." At this
time he and Bell were aboard the train. The conductor told
Wooldridge that he had no right to flag the train. Wooldridge
told him that he had purchased two tickets to Chicago with the
understanding that the train stopped there to let on and off
passengers, furthermore the card stated that this train stopped
there, and arriving there he found that the agent had abandoned
his post and gone home, and he had taken it upon himself
to act as station agent for the time being and stopping a
train. He told the conductor that he had to be in Chicago the
following morning as his business was urgent, furthermore
he could not afford to stand there all night in the rain without
shelter because the station agent had neglected to do
his duty.</p>

<p>On gaining admission to the car Bell was made comfortable:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
By turning two seats together he had two big pillows on which
he might rest his head.</p>

<p>Wooldridge then stooped down and unlaced Bell's shoes
so he could rest his tired feet, he then called the porter and
gave Bell's shoes to him with orders to shine them up and
keep them until the detective called for them next morning.</p>

<p>Wooldridge then reached down into his traveling bag, took
out a pair of leg-irons which he placed around Bell's legs,
and locked them securely. Bell made a protest and assured
the detective that he would not give him any trouble or make
any attempt to get away. Wooldridge told him the first law
of human nature was self-protection and he was exercising that
precaution in this case.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks prior to this time an officer was returning
from New York with a prisoner and neglected to take these
precautions, dosed off into a little sleep, the train had just
then stopped to take on coal, the prisoner only had handcuffs
on, and in the twinkling of an eye passed the officer who was
asleep and succeeded in getting off the train just as it started.
His escape was not noticed by the officer until they had gone
several miles; it was then too late, the bird had flown, and
having money in his pocket found a man who filed the shackles
off his hands. He made good his escape and the officer lost
his job.</p>

<p>After Bell had been securely shackled and made as comfortable
as possible, Wooldridge turned two seats together on
the opposite side of the car, never closed his eyes until they
reached Chicago the following morning, taking Bell to the
Bureau of Identification, had his measure and picture taken.
He was then turned over to Cook County Sheriff.</p>

<p>A few months later J. H. Bell was arraigned for trial and
confronted by over thirty angry women, whom he had robbed,
as witnesses. After a long trial he was found guilty of obtaining
money under the confidence game. He asked for a
new trial which was denied and on March the 9th, 1907, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
was sentenced to Joliet Penitentiary for an indefinite time by
Judge Brentano. His counsel asked for the arrest of judgment
so he might have time to write up the record and present
it to the</p>

<p>Then the Bell luck, which could beat even detectives, broke
Bell's way. Also the Bell honesty suffered a recrudescence. It
so happened that while Bell was in the County Jail a plot was
set on foot to make a big jail delivery.</p>

<p>It was planned, and the plans seemed to have been well
arranged, to smuggle enough dynamite into the jail to wreck
even that formidable building. The plot was hatched by
George Smith, Eugene Sullivan, Morris Fitzgerald and Alfred
Thompson.</p>

<p>On March 2, 1907, this precious crew had been arrested for
robbing a mail wagon. They were apprehended and taken to
the County Jail. There they hatched the plot for the introduction
of the dynamite. Many other prisoners were admitted
to their secret, among them Bell.</p>

<p>Smith, who was as big and powerful as Bell was little and
insignificant, threatened to choke Bell to death in his cell if
he told of the dynamite plot.</p>

<p>Bell's spirit appeared to be as big as the other man's body.
This may have been due to the fact that he saw that "peaching"
on his confederates was the only method of escape. Anyway
Bell "peached." He told of the dynamite plot and the
dynamite was seized. Dr. J. A. Wesener afterward declared
that there was enough of it to have destroyed the whole
building.</p>

<p>It was so undoubtedly true that Bell had been of service to
the state in revealing this plot that a plea for clemency was
made for him and so he escaped the penalty for his crimes.</p>

<p>But the experiences of Bell, and the fear of Detective Clifton
R. Wooldridge had the salutary effect of putting a stop to the
"Show-Card Writing" fraud in Chicago.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_BOGUS_MINE">THE BOGUS MINE.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">$100,000,000 EACH YEAR LOST BY INVESTMENTS
IN FAKE MINING SCHEMES.</p>


<p>To what extent investment swindlers have operated in Illinois
will never be known, for some of them have so thoroughly
covered up their transactions that it will be impossible to disclose
them. This is especially true of a class of mining companies,
the promoters of which remained in the background
while their dupes were gathered in by seemingly respectable
residents. These concerns operated by giving blocks of stock
into the hands of unscrupulous men with good or fairly good
reputations, and the latter disposed of it to such unsophisticated
acquaintances as could be easily gulled.</p>

<p>Gold and silver mines in Colorado, Nevada, and Utah furnished
the basis for most of these swindles. Sometimes the
company really had an old mine or claim that had been abandoned,
sometimes it had a lease on some worthless piece of
property that was "about to be developed," but frequently it
had nothing more than its gaudy prospects and its highly decorated
shares of stock to give in return for the money it received.
Money-grasping church deacons were the favorite
agents for these swindles and widowed women without business
judgment their most common victims.</p>

<p>It is estimated that in this country every year nearly $100,000,000
are taken out of the savings of people of limited means
by financial fakers, especially mining and oil fakers. During
the last five years Detective Wooldridge has observed the
"financiering" of several thousand fake companies, each of
which secured a great deal of money from ignorant people.</p>

<p>Bands of swindlers repair to mining camps and establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
branches there. They expend a few hundred dollars for shreds
and patches of ground void of present or prospective value.</p>

<p>They then form a mining corporation, place its capital stock
at some enormous figure&mdash;a million, two or three million dollars&mdash;appoint
themselves or some of their confederates, or even
their dupes, directors, and sell the worthless claims to the
company for a large proportion, or perhaps, all of the capital
stock of the company.</p>

<p>The stock must be disposed of with a rush. It must all go
within a year or shorter time. When it is gone the suckers
who get the stock for good money may take the property of the
company. They always find an empty treasury, worthless
claims, and the rosy pictures that led them astray, smothered
in the fog.</p>

<p>During the last five years the advertising columns of leading
newspapers have been full of offers of mining stocks as
"sure roads to fortune." Nearly all of these mining companies,
into whose treasuries the public has paid millions, have
either been abandoned or the properties have been sold for
debts, and invariably they bring very little. The major portion
of receipts of these companies from the sales of stock is
stolen by their promoters.</p>

<p>Official statistics of the mining industry show that out of
each one hundred mines, only one has become a success from a
dividend-paying point of view. About five earn a bare existence,
while the balance turn out utter failures.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Promoter's Word Valueless.</span></h3>

<p>Investors will do well to consider that stocks of mines which
are only prospective are the most risky form of gambling. In
buying stocks of the undeveloped mines offered to the public
on the strength of statements the only substance of which is
the imagination of promoters, one runs up against a sure-thing
brace game.</p>

<p>Don't take the promoter's word for it. When you wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
place money where it can work for you, don't bite at the first
"good thing" you see advertised. It is to the interest of the
man who wants to sell you stock to place it before you in the
rosiest light. Otherwise he knows you would not buy it. If
you want to buy stock, don't rely upon what the seller says,
but consult others.</p>

<p>Before consulting persons whom you think may be able to
express an honest and intelligent opinion, ask the promoter
to furnish you a statement of the condition of the company,
showing its assets and liabilities, profits and losses, and an accurate
description of its property.</p>

<p>You will then be able to judge whether the company is over-capitalized;
whether it is incumbered with debts (for debts
may lead to a receivership), and if its earnings may lead to
permanent dividends.</p>

<p>Also ask for a copy of the by-laws of the company. If, with
such information at your disposal, you cannot get a correct idea
as to whether the stock is desirable or not, consult your banker
or somebody else in your community who may be able to advise
you.</p>

<p>If some one offered you a mortgage on a certain piece of
property, common sense would tell you to ascertain whether
the property is sufficient surety for the loan, or if the title to
the property is good and there are not prior incumbrances
on it.</p>

<p>The man who would buy a mortgage without ascertaining
the value and condition of the surety, would be considered an
idiot.</p>

<p>Why not use the same precaution when buying stock? Don't
believe what the promoter tells you about the value and prospects
of the stock he wants to unload on you. Don't take it
for granted the stock offered you will turn out a great money-maker
and dividend-payer because the promoter tells you so.</p>

<p>The promoter, generally a person from another city and entirely
unknown to you, has no interest in you, but is prompted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
by his own selfish interest to sell you something which, in many
cases, he himself would not buy. He may Offer you a good
thing, but it is up to you to find it out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Investigation Necessary.</span></h3>

<p>In most cases, an intelligent investigation will prompt you
to let alluring offers of great wealth for little money severely
alone. The observation of the common-sense rules outlined
above will save investors bitter disappointments and heavy
losses.</p>

<p>It is safe to say seventy-five per cent of the so-called "Mining,
Plantation and Air Line" schemes and "Security" companies
now paraded before the public in flaring advertisements
in the daily papers, and through glittering prospectuses sent
through the mails, are vicious swindles. Men who operate
these frauds pretend to be honest and high-minded. By constant
practice of their wiles upon others they develop self-deception
and come to believe in their honesty to such an extent
that when questioned, they assume a good counterfeit of
honest indignation.</p>

<p>Most of them do not own the furniture in the offices they
occupy while swindling the public. It is a common practice
for them to rent offices in national bank buildings and to furnish
them with rich furniture bought on the installment plan,
to make the necessary "front." They spend their cash capital
for flaring advertisements, sell as much stock as they can induce
the gullible public to buy, and then decamp, leaving unpaid
bills for advertising, if they can get credit after their
cash is exhausted, and their furniture bill unpaid. The absconding
swindler is usually succeeded by an "agent" or "manager,"
who repudiates the bills against his rascally predecessor
and continues the work of fleecing the gullible under some new
title or by means of some new trick.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Keep Lists of Suckers.</span></h3>

<p>Every well-equipped fraudulent concern acquires the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
and addresses of susceptible persons. Painstaking revisions of
the lists made up of these names and addresses form an important
part of the labor of the principals or employes. The
lists grow as each advertisement brings inquiries from persons
who, either through curiosity or desire to invest, write for particulars.
Affiliated swindles operated in succession by a gang
of "fakers" use the same list of "suckers."</p>

<p>In affiliated swindles if the "sucker" does not succumb and
remit his money on the inducements offered by one concern,
his name is transferred to the lists of another, and he is then
bombarded with different literature. Thus a man must pass
through the ordeal of having dozens of tempting offers made
him before he demonstrates that he is not a "sucker," or has
not got the money. His name is then stricken from the list.</p>

<p>There are so many "get-rich-quick" operators at present
that competition between them has become strenuous. They
are now infesting the entire country with local solicitors, who
frequent saloons, hotels, and even residence districts, where
victims are found in foreigners, ignorant servant girls and inexperienced
widows.</p>

<p>These solicitors get 50 per cent commission on all sales of
stock. This fact in itself is evidence that the propositions are
rank swindles. When the swindling operator finds things getting
too hot he disappears from his office and bobs up in some
new place with a new proposition.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pecksniffian Tears Delude.</span></h3>

<p>A few attempts have been made to prosecute the swindlers,
but for the most part the local officials have failed. In but few
instances have the victims been able to give anything like intelligent
statements of the representations made to them.
Where the right sort of agents have been used the people who
have lost their money have not awakened to the fraud passed
upon them. A few Pecksniffian tears have deluded them into
the belief that the swindlers as well as themselves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> victims
of some third party who is in another state and out of
reach.</p>

<p>Where cases have been brought to trial it has been a difficult
matter for juries to understand how the persons aggrieved could
have been caught with the sort of chaff thrown to them, and
there has been little disposition to show charity for the victims.
Then, too, the men hauled before the courts have always made
it appear they were in the same boat with the complaining
witness, and that the culprit was many, many miles away. So,
usually, they have escaped.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Difficult to Convict.</span></h3>

<p>Even in the most flagrant cases and where every advantage
was taken of the ignorance, inexperience or trustfulness of the
person deluded it has been difficult to bring the offense under
the state statutes. It requires more than ordinary misrepresentation
and lying to make out a criminal case, and under the
rules of evidence which prevail it is almost impossible to overtake
a cheat who has not put his misrepresentation into writing
or made them in the presence of third parties.</p>

<p>Where the swindlers have used the mails, however, it is not
such a difficult matter to convict. The United States is scrupulously
jealous of its postal service, and under its statutes every
fellow who undertakes to utilize it for improper purposes can
be brought to book. He can not hide behind some one in another
state, for the federal jurisdiction is general and the other
man can be brought in. Nor can he plead that the business was
legally licensed in another state, or that its incorporation was
regular. If it was a cheat and the mails were used in furtherance
of its design, no corporate cloak thrown around it by any
of the commonwealths can save the promoters.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Power of Uncle Sam.</span></h3>

<p>An example of the power of the federal authorities was given
when Secretary of State Rose of Illinois was trying to keep the
swindling investment companies out of the state. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
before the enactment of the present law regulating the licensing
of corporations. A number of concerns had been formed
in southern states, and they were insolently demanding
licenses to do business in Illinois. The secretary of state was
powerless under the Illinois statutes, but when the matter was
called to the attention of the federal authorities they wiped
out the whole lot of companies with a postal fraud order.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wooldridge Finds Smooth Scheme.</span></h3>

<p>Detective Wooldridge, in looking into many of these mining
frauds, discovered one or two which proved quite a revelation
even to the United States authorities. This was a system of
"kiting" stocks, just as other fraud concerns have been known
to kite checks. The method is very simple.</p>

<p>James Johnson, of Indiana, is "roped in" by one of the
smooth young men who operate for the schemers. James buys
500 or 1,000 shares in the Holy Moses mine, located in or near
Goldfield, Reno, Rawhide, Cripple Creek, or some other well
known mining camp. The "Holy Moses" is a hole dug in the
side of a hill, and all that will ever come out of it is soil.
But that part does not matter. Under certain strict laws now
prevailing only so much stock can be issued even by the schemers.</p>

<p>James Johnson holds his thousand shares for three months.
By this time all the stock has run out and the firm is at the
end of the rope, apparently; but no, they have found a way to
stretch that rope.</p>

<p>William Wilson, of Michigan, is clamoring for a thousand
shares of the "Holy Moses." There is no stock to sell him, and
if any more is printed and issued the waiting detectives will
swoop down at once, for word has gone forth that the "Holy
Moses" is a non-producer. How to get that thousand shares
for Wilson is the problem.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"Holy Moses" Rises?</span></h3>

<p>Aha; it is easy. A letter is drafted to James Johnson, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
to him the gladsome news that "Holy Moses" has gone
up, away up, and that the stock is mounting by leaps and
bounds. Does James Johnson wish to sell his stock at a substantial
advance? James Johnson does.</p>

<p>Well, the philanthropic owners of the "Holy Moses" will
put that stock on the market for him at once and send him the
proceeds, if he will kindly send in his stock with authority for
transfer in blank.</p>

<p>The Indiana sucker bites at the bait and sends in his thousand
shares to be sold. No sooner do they reach the office than
they are immediately started off to Michigan to Wilson, after
the precaution has been taken to remove Johnson's name from
the face of the stock and substitute Wilson's. The authority
for transfer in blank, and the fact that the transaction is a
transfer of stock, is thus kept from Wilson.</p>

<p>In due course of time a fat check from Wilson finds its way
into the coffers of the "Holy Moses" promoters. And also, in
due course of time, Johnson wants to know something about
that sale.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"Holy Moses" Falls.</span></h3>

<p>He is met with the doleful news that while his stock was
on the way to Chicago, or elsewhere, the stock in "Holy Moses"
had experienced such a decided slump that it was impossible
for them to sell it at a profit. If he desires, they will hold the
stock for a raise, which they expect as soon as the present unfortunate
financial panic has passed, or until industrials begin
to go up. The drop in "Holy Moses" is not due to any slump
in the production of the mine; far from it. It is only the unfortunate
financial depression which is to blame, and there is
no doubt but that "Holy Moses" will go up a-whooping very
soon.</p>

<p>Naturally Johnson bites again, and says hold the stock for
that raise. Meanwhile the stock has been procured again from
Wilson and sent to Baker, in Kentucky. And so on, indefinitely.
It is only when some of the swindled ones become particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
savage that their stock is returned to them. And then it is not
their original stock at all, but a new thousand shares which
some sucker has sent in.</p>

<p>One block of stock in one company was sold in this way in
1907 by a Chicago mining company, no less than twelve
times.</p>

<p>The activities of Detective Wooldridge afterward put this
firm out of business, and the head promoter was arrested in the
West by the federal authorities.</p>

<p>It is well that all these facts should be taken into consideration
by the public before investing in mining shares.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">First Principles in Mining Purchases.</span></h3>

<p>Here are a few good leads to follow in buying mining stock.
First make sure that there is a producing mine. Then make
sure that the stock you get is not kited stock. But, above all,
make sure of the responsibility, respectability and solidity of
the firm from which you make the purchase.</p>

<p class="ph3">BANKS IN CHICAGO, NEW YORK AND LONDON
BADLY FLEECED.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Bogus Notes and Stock&mdash;Many Firms Are Victims&mdash;Prisoners
Said to Have Practiced Frauds Under Titles of
Corporations&mdash;Chicago, September 14, 1906, Detectives
Wooldridge and John Hill Uncover the Fraud&mdash;Five
Men Arrested.</b></p>
</div>


<p>A remarkable story of swindling which, extended to many
cities in America and to England, was disclosed, uncovering a
gigantic forgery and check kiting plot as well as several fraudulent
stock selling schemes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicago Concerns Are Victims.</span></h3>

<p>Banks and business concerns, especially in Chicago, suffered
through the operations of the men. Their methods came to
the attention of John Hill, Jr., connected with the Board of
Trade, and Detective Wooldridge learned enough to convince
them and the men behind institutions the objects of which were
to obtain money fraudulently.</p>

<p>Some of the places which have been mulcted are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Commercial National Bank, August 15; bogus note for
$1,078. Stromberg, Allen &amp; Co., printers, 302 Clark street;
bogus note for $206. R. B. Padgham &amp; Co., packing boxes, 59
Dearborn street; bogus note for $300. Matthew Hallohan, 42
River street, September 12; bogus note for $190.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Loses All of Savings.</span></h3>

<p>Julius Radisch, 2509 South Halsted street, a German who
lost $700 in the wreck of the National Fireproofing Company,
told the police of the unique methods used by Johnston in
selling him the stock. He asserts that Johnston told him that
the stock would pay at least 8 per cent dividends, and as proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
of the prosperity of the company took him to the downtown district
and showed him several skyscrapers which he claimed
were owned by the corporation. Radisch also says that Johnston
also pointed out a bank where he said the company had
immense sums on deposit. The story told by Radisch is peculiarly
a sad one, as the money lost by him in the crash of the
Fireproofing company represented the savings of a lifetime of
hard labor. Shortly after the discovery that his money was lost
his wife died.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">One Capitalized at $1,000,000.</span></h3>

<p>The concerns most frequently used by the men in their transactions,
the police say, were known as National Fire Proofing
Company of New York and the Federal Trust Company of
South Dakota. The fire proofing company was stated to be
capitalized at $1,000,000 and the trust company at $100,000.</p>

<p>Offices for each concern were at 1138 Broadway, New York.
From there, it is charged, circulars and pamphlets were sent
out to investors in all parts of the country, and it was also
a practice of these concerns, it is alleged, to open accounts with
banks and exchange bogus notes for good ones.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sheriff in Charge of Affairs.</span></h3>

<p>About one week before the arrest the concerns were placed
in the hands of the sheriff of New York County, and, following
this, it is declared, disclosures were made which hastened
the arrest of the men involved.</p>

<p>Banks and firms in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and
London, it is declared, are known to have suffered through the
alleged operations of the men, who were aided by companions
in the different cities.</p>

<p>Most of the concerns, of which there are at least twelve, all
declared to be fraudulent, are in Chicago.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">List of Bogus Firms.</span></h3>

<p>The following is a list of the concerns, the names of which
have been learned by the police:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">National Fire Proofing Company, New York and Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">Federal Trust Company, New York and Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">Keystone Structure Cleaning Company, Philadelphia.</li>
<li class="ifrst">McGuire, Johnston &amp; Co., New York and Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">Hessley, Johnston &amp; Co.</li>
<li class="ifrst">Hessley &amp; Johnston, Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">A. A. Hessley, Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">George F. Johnston, Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">C. F. McGuire, Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">F. L. Cunningham, Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">Chester E. Broughn, Chicago.</li>
<li class="ifrst">Lincoln Gas Light &amp; Coke Company, Lincoln, Neb.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another concern dealing with alleged spurious bonds of
Custer County, Idaho, the police declare, was under the direction
of these men.</p>

<p>It was the old-time favorite method of kiting checks and
drafts among the banks and private individuals of the city
and country that was used, and there is no doubt that it proved
successful in this instance. Although it is believed the men did
not obtain great riches in their operations in Chicago, it would
have been only a question of time when they would have become
wealthy, so apparently easy was it for them to get funds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Opened Many Bank Accounts.</span></h3>

<p>Accounts in banks in Chicago and other cities were opened
and then exchanges of checks were made among them. Only
the over-boldness of their operations caused their downfall.</p>

<p>An instance of their methods would be the following: The
Federal Trust Company, one of their "paper" concerns, would
deposit a check in a Chicago bank made by the Keystone Structure
Cleaning Company of Philadelphia, another of their alleged
firms. The check would be sent east for collection, and
in a few days it would be returned marked "No funds."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Offer Bond in a Settlement.</span></h3>

<p>Meanwhile the trust company had checked against its account,
to which the Keystone Structure Cleaning Company's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
check had been credited. When the check was returned from
the eastern bank the Chicago bank would notify the Federal
Trust Company of the non-payment of it. The Chicago firm
would then offer explanation and apologies and give a 5 per
cent to concerns that cashed the checks.</p>

<p>When they came back, the men who got the money were
shocked beyond measure and at once offered stock and bonds
of twice the face value of the money involved as security. This
quieted the fears and enabled the schemers to go on.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Five Men Are Arrested by Detectives Wooldridge and
Barry.</span></h3>

<p>Five men were arrested by Detectives Wooldridge and Barry,
charged with operating twelve concerns. The Commercial
National Bank was one of the victims. The men arrested are
as follows:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">Chester A. Broughn, broker, 218 LaSalle street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">S. L. Cunningham, 56 years old. 1009 West Jackson boulevard.</li>

<li class="ifrst">C. F. McGuire, 40 years old, arrested at the Great Northern Hotel.</li>

<li class="ifrst">George F. Johnston, 36 years old, arrested at 185 Dearborn St.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Alvin A. Hessley, 48 years old, arrested at 185 Dearborn St.</li>
</ul>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tool Tells Truth&mdash;Usher of Church in Crime Cloud.</span></h3>

<p>At the age of 50 years, S. L. Cunningham, vestryman and
Sunday School teacher and chief usher in the Jackson Boulevard
Christian Church, has come to the conclusion that he is
"just an old fool, after all."</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham was arrested recently on the charge of
being one of a gang of forgers and "get-rich-quick" men who
have been swindling Chicago and New York business houses
and banks during the last few months. He says his only connection
with the gang was in selling stock until a short time
ago for the National Fireproof Paint Company, one of the
concerns raided, and lending his bank account to George F.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
Johnston, said to have been one of the prime movers in the
gang.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham looks like a bishop. His hair is white and
his appearance distinguished. His story is an illustration of
the manner in which swindling concerns procure one or two
men of weight and respectability in a community to act as
their advance agents and establish confidence.</p>

<p>As he sat on the white-pillared porch of his residence, surrounded
by his wife and sympathetic neighbors and church
members, his face in the gaslight showed the marks of grief
through which he has passed since his arrest.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cunningham Tells the Story.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Yes," he said, "we of the fold often go astray, but I am
innocent. I have a Sunday School class of young girls that I
am going to take out into Lincoln Park tomorrow. I hardly
know what to say to them. I can't bear to think of taking my
place as head usher on Sunday, although my pastor tells me to
march down the aisle with my head erect. I am getting to
be an old man, you see, and I have never wilfully wronged
a person in my life." His voice trembled, but his wife laid
her hand on his arm and he straightened up.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of these men except Mr. Johnston," he
said. "I was introduced to him by a friend of mine three
months ago. I have sold stock and insurance for the last
twenty years, and I thought he had a good thing in the National
Fireproof Paint Company, so I started selling stock
for him. I could not sell the stock, as I could not show enough
assets, so I quit two weeks ago. I was a fool, and a dupe, all
right.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bank Account Overdrawn.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Johnston, a young man, told me he was hard up and asked
to use my bank account at the Commercial National. I let
him and endorsed his checks. My wife told me not to do it,
but I thought he was all right then. Well, he overdrew the
account, the check was protested, and when my name was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
they arrested me. I never knew any of the other men, although
I saw them around the office. They did too much whispering,
and I thought it did not look well."</p>
</div>

<p>Then, in a simple way, he went on to tell of his wife and
his work in the church. He produced a letter from the pastor
of his church, the Rev. Parker Stockdale:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This introduces Mr. Cunningham, a member of my church.
He enjoys among us the reputation of a thorough gentleman
and a conscientious business man. He is a highly respected
and useful citizen. His honesty is beyond question."</p>
</div>

<p>He also had a letter from Col. Jonathan Merriam, former
United States pension agent, which was along the same lines.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Offer of Bribe Alleged.</span></h3>

<p>Broughn, the broker, is a man of a different stripe, according
to Detective Barry, who arrested him. When he was informed
of his arrest he is said by the detective to have replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Come down to the saloon next door. I will settle the case
at once. Name your price."</p>
</div>

<p>When arraigned before Justice Cochrane the cases were continued
until September 24. All the men were released on
$1,200 bonds each, with the exception of Broughn, whose bail
was fixed at $800. The bonds were signed by a professional
bondsman at the Harrison Street Police Station.</p>

<p>C. F. McGuire forfeited his bond and fled to New York City,
where he was apprehended and arrested by New York authorities
at the request of John M. Collins, the Chief of Police.
The information which led to his arrest was secured by Detective
Wooldridge, <span class="smcap">who was made a special messenger by
Charles S. Deneen, Governor of Illinois</span>.</p>

<p>C. F. McGuire was a powerfully built man, weighing 240
pounds and standing over 6 feet tall. He was turned over by
the New York authorities to Detective Wooldridge, who slipped
on him a pair of handcuffs and crossed over to Jersey City on
a ferry, and from there took a section in a Pullman car on
a fast train on the Pennsylvania Railroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>McGuire was put to bed in the upper berth, after he undressed.
Detective Wooldridge told him he was bringing him
back like a gentleman, but the first law of nature was self-protection.
The detective then requested him to turn over all
his clothes except his night shirt, which was done. Wooldridge
then placed the clothes under the mattress in the berth below,
which he was to occupy. He then took out a pair of leg irons,
tied a strong cord to them, placed the leg irons on McGuire,
threw the cord back behind the berth below, and this was
tied to his hands after he had buttoned the berth curtains and
pinned them with safety pins all the way down. The curtains
were then stuffed in under his mattress. After all this was
done Wooldridge then laid down with his clothes on and laid
awake until morning, but managed to get some rest by laying
down.</p>

<p>Chicago was reached in safety. After taking McGuire to
the bureau, where Bertillon measurements were taken and his
finger prints recorded, he was turned over to the sheriff of
Cook County.</p>

<p>The trial was set, which lasted five days. Witnesses were
brought from the banks in New York City and Philadelphia
which had been victimized.</p>

<p>February 7, 1908, found guilty.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Check "Kiters" Heavily Fined&mdash;George F. Johnston and
C. F. McGuire Assessed $2,000 Each.</span></h3>

<p>A jury in Judge Kersten's court later returned a verdict
finding George F. Johnston and C. F. McGuire guilty of
swindling and imposed a fine of $2,000 each. If the fine be
not paid the defendants will be compelled to serve the amount
at the rate of $1.50 a day in the Bridewell. Chester A. Broughn
and A. H. Hessley entered pleas of guilty at the last minute
and their cases will be disposed of later by Judge Kersten.
State's Attorney John J. Healy and Assistant State's Attorney
Barbour expressed themselves as pleased over the outcome of
the trial.</p>

<h2><a id="QUACKS">QUACKS.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">RASCALS WHO PREY UPON THE IGNORANT.</p>

<p class="center"><b>The "Specialist," the "Optician," the "Doctors' College";
All Frauds.</b></p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="center"><b>Blackmail Helps Medical Scamps&mdash;Poor Girls Victims of
"Doctor" Thieves.</b></p>


<p>The history of quacks and quackery includes some of the
most glaring frauds ever perpetrated on a credulous people. In
all ages of the world's history down to the present day, these
humbugs have cut an important figure in their day and generation.
They are numerous in almost every line of business,
serving God when it pays them to do it, and assisting the devil
when their interests demand it. In these pages I propose to
deal with medical quacks only.</p>

<p>The advent of every discovery in medicine, slight though it
may be, has brought to the front a ring of pretenders in the
healing art. These fellows catch the multitude. The poor,
the ignorant and the credulous are their followers. It has
been so in every age of the world's history. The man or woman
with broken health will catch at every straw that offers hope
of recovery, and so they drift from one quack to another, until
ruined in fortune and oftentimes made worse in their physical
ills, they at last pass to the silent home where the pain and
joy the cunning and simplicity of the world are alike of insignificance.</p>

<p>The desire to live lurks in the heart of nearly every human
being. And no matter how wretched they may be, how poor
in pocket, broken in spirit, whether suffering from real or
imaginary ills, thirsting for relief, they have gone from quack
to quack, giving of their meager savings for some vaunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
elixir which in all probability only hastens their journey to the
grave.</p>

<p>One reason why quackery flourishes is the fact that medicine
is not a science. Ask any honest physician and he will tell you
the same. A drug that will help one person will have no
effect on another. There are in the realm of medicine no such
things as "cures." People who are sick recover, but they would
do so whether they took "dope" or not. All disease is self-limited.
The doctor who talks of curing smallpox, measles,
typhoid fever, is a fool. Natures cures, not the doctor. People
get well of these complaints, and many others who take no
medicines and employ no physicians.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Physic to the Dogs.</span></h3>

<p>Followers of the late "Elijah Dowie" relegated physic to the
dogs, where it properly belongs, and yet enjoyed good health.
Mrs. Eddy's converts take no drugs, not even simple household
remedies.</p>

<p>Here is a body of people numbering millions, entirely repudiating
physicians, yet their health is as good, if not better, than
those who continually take drugs. Doctors make war on them.
Why? It interferes with the medical graft.</p>

<p>Don't think for a minute that advertising doctors are the
only grafters in the medical profession. Many of them are
bad, very bad, but there are men right here in Chicago, as
well as other big cities, who never advertise in papers, yet they
are as notorious swindlers, and will as quickly take advantage
of the ignorant and credulous, as the man who flaunts his skill
in the daily press. To fall into the hands of these fellows is
to be despoiled in pocket and ruined in health. Operations
that are uncalled for and not needed are performed almost
daily.</p>

<p>Only a short time ago I heard a doctor boast of having removed
the ovaries of two thousand women. How many of these
operations were actually necessary? Probably very few, but each
case enriched him to the extent of several hundred dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>Women more frequently than men are the victims of unscrupulous
doctors. People do not often question the skill or
the opinion of the fashionable physician; they take for granted
the truth of all he may say, forgetting for the time that he
has a pecuniary interest in the work that may possibly result in
the death of the patient.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Unnecessary Operations.</span></h3>

<p>How many people die from wholly unnecessary operations?
Only the hospital records and the immediate friends of the
patient can tell.</p>

<p>These words are written to put people on their guard. Dishonest
doctors are everywhere, especially in big cities. Chicago
is full of them. They may be strictly ethical and affect
to despise the advertiser. They do so, however, only from a
business standpoint. They hate opposition, and somehow the
advertising doctor manages to get a goodly share of the business,
and is oftentimes the superior in skill in his particular
line or specialty to his ethical brother.</p>

<p>There are good doctors and bad ones, just as there are good
and bad men in every walk and business of life.</p>

<p>In my experience as a detective I have met with both kinds.
In these pages I will deal with the advertising doctor only. I
will do, and have done, what I can to drive the dishonest ones
out of the business.</p>

<p>The eye doctor, professing to cure blindness or other diseases
of the eye without the knife, is one of the most dangerous
and dishonest men in the medical profession. Chicago has its
full quota of this form of quackery. There are two men in this
city&mdash;Dr. M&mdash;&mdash; and Dr. O&mdash;&mdash;, who are national advertisers.</p>

<p>Both have been exposed in a recent New York weekly paper
at the instigation of the American Medical Association. It is
noteworthy, however, that this same paper accepted a full-page
advertisement from Dr. O&mdash;&mdash; only a few months before
the expose, thus deluding thousands of its readers. The price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
paid for one page and one issue was fifteen hundred dollars.
This sum, paid to but one paper, will give the reader some idea
of the vast expense to which the quack is put to place his name
before the public in his effort to rob the blind. This same Dr.
O&mdash;&mdash; pays out annually sixty thousand dollars for advertising
alone. He employs twenty typewriters&mdash;mostly girls.
The correspondence is handled entirely by the clerks, the doctor
rarely ever seeing a letter.</p>

<p>He employs but one assistant, a young man fresh from college.
No personal interviews with patients are asked for or
desired. It is a mail order business almost exclusively. Occasionally
a patient comes to the city to see this great oculist.</p>

<p>Dr. O&mdash;&mdash; himself is hardly ever in evidence. He spends
most of his time in summer resorts and European capitals.</p>

<p>The only medicine used is a solution of boric acid in water.
The same can be bought at any drug store for a few cents.
His charges are ten dollars per month.</p>

<p>This man's mail is enormous. I have known him to take in
twenty thousand dollars a month. One of the catchy lines in
his advertisement says he cures crossed eyes without the use
of the knife. This is true, but he uses scissors instead. Cross-eye
can only be straightened by severing the muscles of the eye.
All physicians know this, but the people do not; hence the
success of this robber of the blind.</p>

<p>Dr. O&mdash;&mdash; is a devout church member. He is one of the
largest contributors to the Christian Church, to which he belongs.
Nearly all church papers carry his advertisements,
though they must know him to be a fraud of the first water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sleek and Unctuous Church Member.</span></h3>

<p>Personally he is sleek and unctuous, is always found among
the godly, takes more interest in foreign missions than the
every-day affairs of life, and fully expects to occupy a seat in
the parquet of the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The money wrung by the basest of false pretenses from his
poor unfortunate blind victims, does not disturb his slumbers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
If he has any conscience at all he fortifies himself with the
thought that "Jesus will bear it all," and lets it go at that.</p>

<p>Blind people, or those with failing eyesight, beware.</p>

<p>A close second to the above-named grafter, and in the same
nefarious business, is Dr. M&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>This man's advertisements read very much like those of
others in the same line of work. He also cures without the
knife, but uses the scissors. His treatment is the same&mdash;boric
acid and water.</p>

<p>This can do no possible good except in slight inflammations.
It cannot cure cataract. It may be set down as a truth (ask
any honest physician) that cataract is incurable except by surgical
operations. Yet these men continue to advertise its cure,
claiming to have a specific remedy that will absorb it. Dr.
M&mdash;&mdash; is wealthy, all made out of the blind. While other
men are giving of their wealth to ease the lives of these poor
unfortunates, they are being systematically robbed in the most
heartless and shame-faced manner.</p>

<p>Priceless is sight. A man or woman threatened with loss of
it will give up their last dollar for a prospective cure. In
this way these so-called "eye doctors" fatten on the credulity
of their victims, doing them absolutely no good and quite often
a serious injury.</p>

<p>Dr. M&mdash;&mdash; is also a devout church member. He can
be seen hanging over the pew of a fashionable West Side church
every Sunday. There he is hailed as a good brother by his
fellow members, many of whom are as great, if not as successful,
a grafter as he is. They use the cloak of religion in
which to serve the devil.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The "Optician" Fake.</span></h3>

<p>In connection with this subject let me warn you of the existence
of an army of "Opticians." These men are often swindlers
of the first water. Their misrepresentations as to the money
value of glasses amounts to grand larceny. They charge all the
way from ten to seventy-five dollars for a pair of lenses that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
usually cost seventy-five cents each. There are honest men
in the business, but beware of the grafter.</p>

<p>There are many lesser lights engaged in the eye business, but
the examples given above will serve to place you on your guard.
Take no treatment by mail. Less can be done for the eye than
any other organ of the body, unless it is the ear. Both are so
complex in their anatomy and the symptoms so obscure that it
is an impossibility to make a correct diagnosis without seeing
the patient and using the best instruments that science can
bring to the aid of the physician.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Consumption Cures.</span></h3>

<p>A few years ago Dr. Koch, of Berlin, Germany, announced
that he had discovered a cure for consumption. The same announcement
has been made thousands of times before by more
or less illustrious physicians.</p>

<p>Dr. Koch's cure was a gas, requiring more or less elaborate
apparatus. Several years' trial of this supposed cure convinced
the medical profession, and Dr. Koch himself, that he
was mistaken.</p>

<p>He retracted his statements and acknowledged he had been
in error. Yet in every large city of the country, Chicago, of
course, included, there are established "Koch Institutes" for
the cure of consumption.</p>

<p>A more brazen fraud was never perpetrated on an ignorant
public than the claims which these so-called institutes advertise.
They are patronized chiefly by the poor&mdash;those who have
been told by honest physicians that they are incurable. Having
no means with which to take trips to the mountain or sea
shore, they grasp at every quack medicine or institute that offers
hope of recovery.</p>

<p>I have visited the Chicago branch of this miserable fraud.
Invalids who can scarcely walk are to be seen there daily inhaling
mixtures of nauseous gases that have no more effect on
the germ of consumption than a popgun on one of Uncle
Sam's ironclads. By means of paid-for testimonials and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
couple of "cappers," people from all parts of the country are
brought here, oftentimes taking the last dollar of the family
exchequer to pay for the so-called treatment. These frauds
have been exposed time and again. However, a new crop of
victims are gathered in every day and the game goes merrily
on.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Human Ghouls.</span></h3>

<p>The human ghouls in the guise of doctors are meantime living
in luxury, and fattening on the misfortunes of their already
half-dead victims. You might ask why does not the law step in
and protect the sick. If you had seen as much of the law as
I have you would discover that it too frequently protects the
doctors and not the patients.</p>

<p>The men running this and other similar frauds are all licensed
physicians, and have the authority of the great State of
Illinois to pursue their calling. If you have consumption spend
your money in getting good air, not dope. Drugs never yet
cured consumption. That is the testimony of all honest doctors,
and there are still a few of them left.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Morphine Cure.</span></h3>

<p>Forty years ago Dr. C&mdash;&mdash;, of Laporte, Indiana, a
bricklayer by profession, conceived the idea of selling morphine
as a cure for the opium habit. Morphine is the essence of
opium, just as cocaine is the essence of the coca leaf. It was a
brilliant idea and brought Dr. C&mdash;&mdash; (he afterward
bought diplomas galore) a mint of money. C&mdash;&mdash; constructed
himself a mansion in Laporte, which stands today, a
splendid specimen of the builders' art. He was the first man
to put on the market an opium cure.</p>

<p>The poor wretches who are addicted to this habit would make
any kind of a sacrifice for a cure. The whiskey habit is not a
circumstance to the opium or morphine fiend. There is no
habit which so enslaves the victim as the drug habit, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
are seldom cured. C&mdash;&mdash; ran along for many years with
but few imitators. The many victims of morphine whom he
has gathered into his net were pouring in their wealth until it
amounted to thousands daily. As long as they took the
C&mdash;&mdash; remedy they had no desire for morphine. The
"remedy" contained morphine&mdash;more, usually, than they had
been taking before.</p>

<p>"Dr." C&mdash;&mdash; had thousands under treatment, but made no
cures. At last the so-called remedy was analyzed and its true
nature discovered.</p>

<p>At once an army of imitators sprang into existence in all
parts of the country, and morphine cure became as common as
other cures. They all had and have as a basis opium or some
of its salts. The extent of these drug addictions is hardly
realized. Chicago alone has thirty thousand of these unfortunates,
and the trade in opium and allied drugs is immense.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Encouraging the Morphine Habit.</span></h3>

<p>Many of these victims date their downfall from some sickness
in which a physician prescribed the drug&mdash;perhaps to allay
pain or produce sleep. When they recovered they found they
still had to have it. The habit grew and finally fastened itself
with such a deathlike grip that they were unable to shake it
off, and so they totter through life, unfitted for anything except
to beg, borrow or lend some of the dope. Men and women
once high in the business and social world are frequently found
in the police dock accused of some petty theft in order to satisfy
their craving for these destructive drugs.</p>

<p>Chicago has its quota of doctors who "cure" the morphine
habit, but always in the way that "Dr." C&mdash;&mdash; did. Most of
them are "fiends" themselves who eke out a living selling the
drug to other victims in the form of a "cure." If by any
chance you have contracted the habit steer clear of all so-called
cures. The remedy is worse than the disease.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cancer Cure.</span></h3>

<p>One can hardly pick up a paper or magazine that does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
carry the advertisement of Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;, of Indianapolis, Ind.,
with branch institutes at Kansas City and other places. Dr.
B&mdash;&mdash;'s remedy is an oil for which he claims wonderful properties.</p>

<p>In reply to an inquiry the doctor sends out a little book,
filled with testimonials from grateful patients, dependent
preachers and his fellow church members. The book tells you
that the doctor has even built a church all by himself and
maintains it at his own expense, even paying the salary of
the pastor out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that all successful quacks appeal to the
religious element of the community. A man who is really
religious is honest; having no tinge of dishonesty himself, he
suspects none in others. He therefore falls easily into the net
of the charlatan.</p>

<p>The quack knows this, hence his use of the religious press
in which to exploit the virtues of his medicines.</p>

<p>Does Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; cure cancer? Yes. There are seven varieties
of cancer; two malignant, which all physicians agree are
incurable, and five non-malignant, of which the wart and wen
are good examples. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; cures the non-malignant varieties
only, and you can do the same yourself by the application
of a few drops of glacial acetic acid to the growth once a day.</p>

<p>This is the whole secret of the so-called cures wrought by
these men. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; never cured a genuine malignant cancer
in his life, and never will until a specific is discovered that will
combat it. He has grown very rich, is known as a public-spirited
gentleman and to say aught against him in his native town is
to bring down on one's head the wrath of the business community.
Why?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Patients from Everywhere.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; has patients coming from all parts of the country.
They bring and spend money at his sanitariums. It is
"business," and I am only sorry to say that what is known as
business is too often larceny. If you have a growth you do
not understand, trust it to your family physician, if he is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
honest man, rather than to one of the many cancer sharks that
infest the country.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Rupture Cure.</span></h3>

<p>This, when offered by mail, as it is in almost every magazine
that accepts medical advertisements, is also a glaring fraud
upon a most helpless class of people. While it is true that a
well fitted truss will retain and often cure a rupture, yet the
quacks who advertise the rupture cure propose to cure you by
mail, then by application of a wonderful oil which they sell
at ten dollars per bottle, they propose to close up the opening
through which the rupture descends and effect a permanent
cure. A few years back the surgical treatment of rupture
was not always a success, hence people so afflicted had reason
to avoid operations.</p>

<p>Today the cure of rupture is not attended by any danger.
Surgery has made many advances in the past few years. People
who are ruptured should avoid any other means of cure
than the operations.</p>

<p>There are not less than twenty-five advertising specialists
in Chicago who profess to cure rupture without operation.</p>

<p>They only succeed in separating you from your money. My
advice is not to go near them, lest you regret it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Female Diseases.</span></h3>

<p>It is well known among the readers of the daily press that
all the advertisements of a medical nature addressed to women
are meant to cover the nefarious business of the abortionist.</p>

<p>The commissioner of health in a recent interview stated that
not less than fifty thousand abortions are committed yearly
in Chicago. It is well to state that only a small number of
these are performed by the advertising abortionists. Most of
them are the work of regular physicians.</p>

<p>Indeed, in no other way could this immense destruction of
infant life take place. I know of physicians here in Chicago
who have and do no other business. I have in mind one palatial
residence on Michigan avenue patronized exclusively by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
the rich. It is presided over by a strictly ethical physician.
This man's fee is from one thousand to five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The poor content themselves with less pretentious places and
prices. I know of physicians on the north side and the west
side who do this work for five and ten dollars. They have as
many as ten and twelve cases a day.</p>

<p>Up to a few weeks ago all of the Chicago papers contained
a list of advertisements under the classification of medical,
about as follows:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">"Maternity Hospital&mdash;Ladies taken care of before and after
confinement."</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Mrs. Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;, licensed midwife, takes ladies for confinement,
etc."</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Dr. Anna B&mdash;&mdash; Elegant home for ladies expecting confinement,
etc."</li>
</ul>

<p>The above are only samples of a long list of advertisements
of similar tenor which appeared daily in the Chicago press for
twenty-five years. These advertisements attracted the attention
of people in the country. They were not designed to attract
city people. People residing here seldom patronize them
on account of the high prices usually charged. They know
cheaper doctors. Girl from the smaller towns and the farms
are the ones sought.</p>

<p>The girl applying for relief at any of these places was usually
told that abortions were unlawful and dangerous to life. She
was strongly advised to stay in the hospital, which offered perfect
seclusion, until the full period when the child would be
naturally born and without danger to either of them. This
advice was generally accepted and the price agreed upon paid.
This was always all the girl had with her, and the promise
of more. The amount ranged from one hundred to five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>The money paid over, the girl was shown to a pleasant room,
and invited to make herself at home. There were always other
girls there, usually under assumed names. They kept coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
and going every few days. None remained longer than ten
days.</p>

<p>After the girl had been there a couple of days the madam
announced that the doctor would call on her that day and
make an examination, so as to approximate the time of baby's
arrival.</p>

<p>With a very small instrument the abortion was produced
while making the examination, the patient knowing nothing of
it. This is done so deftly that labor pains do not come on for
sometimes two days afterwards.</p>

<p>In ten days the patient is ready to leave the hospital. The
fee having been paid, both parties are usually satisfied, and
the girl, if she is wise, makes her misfortune a stepping stone
to something better.</p>

<p>If the amount paid has been too small to satisfy hospital
funds, an effort is made to collect more, but usually not from
the girl.</p>

<p>The madam gets the patient's confidence and discovers, if
she can, the man responsible for the girl's condition. A bill
is then sent him for several hundred dollars. Should he
ignore it or refuse to pay, he is politely told that the account
will be placed in the hands of a lawyer in the town where
he resides and the matter can be adjusted by a "jury of his
fellow citizens."</p>

<p>Imagine the consternation of some business man or church
deacon in a small community over the receipt of such a letter.</p>

<p>If guilty, and they are as a general thing, they take the
next train for Chicago and pay the bill. Parties running these
establishments are money makers. I know of one on West
Adams street whose owner has made a fortune of two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, all accumulated in twenty
years.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Electric Belt Fraud.</span></h3>

<p>This is another one of the many humbugs that seem to
have fastened themselves on the country. Chicago is the center<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
for this as well as every other fake of a medical character.</p>

<p>These belts are of the cheapest construction and are made
at a cost of twelve and one-half cents each. They sell for
anything, up to three hundred and even five hundred dollars.
There may be virtue in electricity, properly applied, but there
certainly is none in the belt.</p>

<p>Dr. McL&mdash;&mdash; is located in Chicago, and has branch offices in
almost every state in the union. He takes pages in the daily
press to tell of the virtues of his belt. It cures everything
from lumbago to corns. He usually pictures a man in a half-stooping
position, holding his back with one hand, while with
the other he is getting a belt from a sympathizing doctor.</p>

<p>Dr. McL&mdash;&mdash; has made big money duping his fellow men. Recently
he opened an office in the City of Mexico. There the
government protects people somewhat from their own folly.</p>

<p>A Mexican bought a belt, guaranteed to cure his disease:
it failed. The doctor was promptly arrested for obtaining
money under false pretenses. He was sent to jail, where he
remained sixteen months.</p>

<p>The offices were closed and have not since been reopened.
The best evidence that electric belts are a useless article is
to be found in the fact that physicians neither use nor prescribe
them. They are an adjunct to quackery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Varicocele Cure.</span></h3>

<p>To begin with, varicocele is a surgical disease and is only
cured by an operation. Yet the daily papers teem with advertisements
offering cures by drugs, appliances and external
washes.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that all of these are fakers. Chicago
has more than twenty specialists who profess to cure varicocele.
Only two of them fulfill their promises. The rest take
your money and render you no service.</p>

<p>Nearly every paper advertises these men, such headlines as
"Cured in Five Days," "Cured Without Pain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p>"Five-day varicocele cure" meets the eye of the reader on
nearly every page. It is true that varicocele can be cured
in five days; it can and is cured in one treatment, but always
by surgical means. The headlines above are simply baits for
the afflicted.</p>

<p>The main idea of the so-called specialist is to get the victim
into his office. Here he will tell him that he has two methods
of cure. One is an operation, which necessitates the patient
going to a hospital, remaining there for five days in order
to effect the cure. The other is a suspensory and a liniment
which, applied daily, will do just as well, but it requires
three or four months to get the cure.</p>

<p>The patient wishes, of course, to avoid an operation. He
is always told there is some danger from the chloroform. He
usually takes the "slow cure," parting at the same time with
a good, fat fee, usually a good deal more than he would have
had to pay a reputable man for an operation. At the end of
the period fixed for the cure the patient finds himself no better
and finally in disgust places himself in the hands of a
man who does operate and is promptly cured.</p>

<p>Among the many men engaged in the cure of varicocele is
Dr. Mark K&mdash;&mdash;, of Cincinnati and Denver. This man's advertisements
adorn every page of papers that will take them.
His fee is $2.00; his remedy a suspensory and a wash. Both
are utterly useless. After you have paid your money your
name or original letter is sold to someone in the same business.</p>

<p>In a little while you are surprised to receive mail from all
parts of the country&mdash;all wanting you to purchase a varicocele
cure. This applies to vacuum pumps, the superior system, the
Parisian system and other fakes of a like nature. They are
all frauds. In the past few years I have raided their places
many times, seized their literature, which is always obscene
and indecent, and arrested the proprietors. The game, however,
still goes on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The "Nervous Debility Specialist."</span></h3>

<p>"Lost Manhood Restored" is probably the greatest of all
medical grafts. These men succeed simply because of the
total ignorance of the people on matters pertaining to the
sexual system.</p>

<p>If sexual physiology was a part of the studies in the public
schools for pupils at the age of fourteen there would be no
cases of nervous debility, and the "lost manhood" physician
would have to seek other fields for the display of his talents.</p>

<p>One of the saddest of all the habits that young men drop
into at some period of their lives is the secret vice. Until
quite lately prudery has prevented its proper discussion and
about the only literature on the subject was to be found in
that issued by advertising doctors who treat the effects.</p>

<p>One thing is certain&mdash;no one ever acquired the habit by
reading one of these "scare" or quack books. John Stuart
Mill, in speaking of this vice, says: "The diseases of society
can be no more checked or healed without publicly speaking
of them than can those of the body." To ignore or deny the
prevalence of the evil is sometimes honest ignorance, but is more
often hypocrisy.</p>

<p>A little scientific discussion on this subject is not out of
place here. It will put young men on their guard against
themselves, and cut off in some degree the income of that class
of doctors who live on their credulity.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to trace its origin it has always
been with us. According to Ovid, Horace and Aristophanes,
it was a curse in ancient Greece and Rome. Even Hippocrates,
the father of medicine 380 years before Christ, considered it
a subject worthy of his pen. Of modern writers the greatest
was Tissot, in 1760, who issued a classic on this subject whose
object was to stay, if possible, the abuses and vices which threatened
the ruin of the French people. Lurid as the little book
distributed by specialists usually is, the effects of this vice
depicted by Tissot puts them all into the shade. If not exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
scientific, it at least exerted a large moral influence which was
beneficial in the then state of public and private morals.</p>

<p>In the discussion of secret sin let us make it plain that
the evil effects are not immediate, as is often thought and frequently
taught by school teachers and writers. The brain is not
palsied at once. Dementia, palsy and sudden death are not
likely to occur. The erroneous idea that it does, accounts in
a great measure for the terror, the bashfulness and the love
of solitude exhibited by this class of sufferers.</p>

<p>It is enough for the purpose of this article that in the course
of physical decay, gray hair, baldness and enfeebled gait, weakness
of the muscular and nervous system, in fact, a general
lowering of the tone of the bodily health, appear. Life has
been lived out with abandon, its energies have been overdrawn
and its wheels have run down like the mainspring of a clock
whose regulator has been lost.</p>

<p>The sporty and fast life led by reckless youth is making him
pay the penalty. And what is the penalty? Look at the daily
papers, see the brazen medical advertisements, "Manhood Restored"
staring at you from every page. These advertisements
are costly. They run up into the thousands of dollars a month.
One man, a doctor of Chicago, formerly paid the daily press
eight thousand dollars a month for advertising; his "Lost
Manhood, Varicocele and Hydrocele Cured" appeared in almost
every paper in this city.</p>

<p>And the people who needed the treatment paid the bills. So
powerful was this man's influence that he was enabled to
stave off undesirable legislation at Springfield. In this he was
aided by the newspapers, who did not wish to lose this princely
revenue from quack doctors.</p>

<p>This doctor is still in business, but on a small scale compared
to former times. Competition and the advent of more
mendacious liars have reduced his income to more modest
proportions than it once was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Monumental Swindle.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>MEN who need treatment or advice concerning their
health or any weakness or private disease should, before
taking any treatment whatever, go to Dr. S. for consultation,
examination and advice; free.</p>

<p>DR. S.&mdash;Longest Established, Most Successful and
Reliable Specialist in Diseases of Men, as Medical
Diplomas, Licenses and Newspaper Records Show.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. S. first came to Chicago about the time of the World's
Fair. His home office was supposed to be in Philadelphia.
While Philadelphia has the reputation of being slow, yet the
methods of Dr. S. were decidedly swift, so much so that he
almost took the breath away from the Chicago specialists.</p>

<p>He was the first to charge for medicine in addition to his
fees. It is a well-known fact that a man having been under
the treatment of Dr. S. for a week or a month never seeks
the aid of another one.</p>

<p>He has been cured? Not on your life. He has been robbed.
I have known this "Doctor" to charge as much as one hundred
dollars for two small bottles of dope. This is in addition to
a fee of twenty-five to five hundred dollars. He always operates
a "drug store" in connection with his office.</p>

<p>The patient, having undergone an examination and having
been thoroughly frightened, is told what the fee will be. This
being paid, he is given a prescription and sent to the "drug
store."</p>

<p>This is so written that no other drug store can fill it. In a
short time he is handed two or three small bottles, and on
asking "how much" is told a sum varying from ten to one
hundred and fifty dollars. Surprised and indignant, he hastens
back to the "Doctor" and complains. He is told that the medicines
are cheap at that price; that they are expensive drugs and
very necessary in his case.</p>

<p>If the patient has the money he pays it, resolving that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
will have no more to do with Dr. S. If he lives in the country
he is surprised the following week by getting notice from the
express company that a C. O. D. package awaits him at the
office.</p>

<p>It is the second week's supply of medicine. Charges from
twenty-five to ninety-eight dollars. He at once writes to the
"Doctor" and says he doesn't want the stuff.</p>

<p>The first supply has done him no good. It's too expensive
and he can't afford to continue it.</p>

<p>The "Doctor" writes back and says that he must pay for it.
It will require three months to effect a cure, and the whole
treatment has been prepared. If he does not take it the office
will be subject to a loss of many hundreds of dollars. They
also threaten him with a suit for the recovery of the amount.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blackmail an Adjunct.</span></h3>

<p>The poor victim, almost frightened to death at the prospect
of exposure, usually compromises and pays all the money he
can raise, taking the three months' "treatment" which he is
assured has been specially prepared for his case.</p>

<p>It is not an uncommon thing for Dr. S. to get several thousand
dollars out of one patient. Men have been known to
mortgage their farms to get out of the clutches of these cormorants.
They never let go until the last dollar has been extracted
from the poor patient. After his experience with Dr. S.
he wants no more. He thinks that they are all alike and carefully
avoids them in the future.</p>

<p>Dr. S. himself is not in Chicago. He is said to live in Philadelphia.
He operates offices in this city and several other
places. Three men comprise the office staff&mdash;one man who
"takes" the case, another a physician, usually a dummy engaged
at a salary of fifteen to twenty dollars a week, and a
druggist.</p>

<p>The main guy of every medical quack office is the "case
taker." He is always a "confidence man" skilled in the business.
He plays upon the fears and credulity of his victims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
He pictures the most dreadful fate awaiting the unfortunate
patient. If a case of private disease, he knows that the patient
will rot on his feet and become a charnel house of infection.</p>

<p>If a "Lost Manhood" case, he pictures the horrors of impotency,
a trusting girl deceived, a divorce, together with the
scandals that precede and follow.</p>

<p>The above advertisement appears right along in the Chicago
dailies. If Dr. S&mdash;&mdash; is the "Prince of swindlers" the
B&mdash;&mdash; Medical Institute is a good second.</p>

<p>It is owned and run by a Bohemian, who changed his name
from an almost unpronounceable one to that of Hansen. He
employs cheap doctors&mdash;mostly dope fiends&mdash;men who could
not get employment elsewhere. His pay is about fifteen dollars
per week. This man also runs a "dental" Institute where
equally cheap dentists are employed. Both institutes rob the
unsuspecting.</p>

<p>Hansen was sued by a former patient and nearly four hundred
dollars recovered, quite recently. The man was absolutely
free from any disease, but was frightened into paying that
amount to get rid of an imaginary one.</p>

<p>He is a common, cheap, medical swindler.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Swindler a "Dope" Fiend.</span></h3>

<p>The above advertisement is that of Dr. C&mdash;&mdash;. C&mdash;&mdash; himself
is out of the game. He is a dope fiend. A few months
ago he narrowly escaped the penitentiary for taking $225 from
a sixteen-year-old child. He was fined $200 in the Municipal
Court, paid it and quit the business.</p>

<p>Previously, however, he had sold the use of his name to
Dick Williams, owner of several of the so-called medical offices
along State street. Williams changes his doctors every
few days, so that a patient hardly ever sees the same man twice.
Each man makes an effort to "re-fee" the patient&mdash;that is,
they try to extract more money in the way of fees, claiming
that the other "doctor" did not grasp the severity of the case.
It is not unusual for a patient to pay half a dozen fees in the
same office before he drops onto the fact that he is being systematically
robbed.</p>

<p>The main object of advertising cheap is to get the people
into the office and started on the treatment. Money is demanded
at every visit and new "diseases" discovered as long
as the credulity of the patient lasts.</p>

<p>This is a sad, sad story, because it is an obituary, the death

has ever taken the hoarded pennies of children and working
girls, the "late lamented" "turf syndicate."</p>

<p>Several years ago the turf syndicate was in its glory. A
poor girl, fresh from the old country, would scrub floors for
a week or take in washing for a month in order to pour money
into the pockets of these swindlers. Thanks to the efforts of
Detective Clifton E. Wooldridge, of Chicago, and others, this
particular fraud is now a thing of the past.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Gigantic Turf Swindle.</span></h4>

<p>Among the first of the get-rich-quick schemes into which
the public poured millions was the "turf investment" concern.
The "literature" of probably no other class of swindle was
so plausible as this. The promise was to pay 5 and in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
cases 10 per cent on the investment each week. The method
by which the promise was to be fulfilled was this: The money
invested was to be placed in a pool and used as capital in
playing the races. A standard bet of a certain amount was to
be made. If this wager was lost, enough money out of the
pool was to be bet on the horse picked by the managers of the
concern in the next race, to recoup the loss on the first race,
win the amount set out to win on the first race, together with
a like amount on the second race. If this wager was lost, the
process was to be repeated on the next race, and so on until a
wager was won. Each time there was a winning, a large
enough sum would have been bet to recoup all losses on previous
races and win a fixed amount on each of the races played.
Some concerns claimed to play the favorite horses in the betting,
others the second choices to win and others to bet according
to "inside information" derived from horse owners and
jockeys.</p>

<p>Regardless of the variations of the scheme, the general plan
was the same. The prospectuses, in a most plausible way, set
forth the claim that "beating the races" was merely a matter
of having a large enough capital at hand to continue the progressive
betting plan.</p>

<p>By the claim that horse racing was as legitimate a calling
as dealing on the Board of Trade or Stock Exchange and possessed
the additional advantage of being open to persons of
small means, a strong appeal was made to the poor.</p>

<p>Of course, none of the money that poured in ever was bet.
Had 5 per cent a week on all the millions contributed by the
public to this form of swindle been actually derived from the
bookmakers, every penciler in the country would have been
bankrupted in a month. The remarkable feature of the "turf"
investment scheme is that this phase of the matter seemed
never to occur to investors, and the other palpably impossible
phases of the operators' claims were also overlooked in the
effort to secure 260 per cent a year on the investment made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Get-Rich-Quick Schemes.</span></h4>

<p>As in the horse swindles, the older investors were paid their
dividends from funds sent in by new ones. No attempt was
made to win dividends in the market. As the gullibility of
the "suckers" became a little dulled, innovations to increase
the plausibility of the schemes were made and new forms of
bait devised.</p>

<p>"Turf swindles" have flourished, while the victims, who
number tens of thousands, dare not raise their voices in protest
or complaint, well knowing that they would not only be the
butt of ridicule in their community, but also that the world
at large would rather rejoice at their losses, and courts and
juries would probably waste little sympathy on them. Consequently
the safest swindles operated today are those having
race-track betting for their basis.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1902 there were upwards of twenty-five
of these schemes in operation in the United States. New York
City was the headquarters for about ten, and the balance were
located in St. Louis, Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco,
Cincinnati and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Their prosperity was evidenced by the ability of managers
to buy advertising space in the leading newspapers, to pay
the printers for the most elaborate booklets, circulars, etc.,
and Uncle Sam for postage stamps, with which they were
extremely liberal, usually sending a stamped envelope, for
reply, to prospective investors.</p>

<p>Extracts which I give below from the literature of five of
these concerns offer a fair criterion for the whole mass which
I have before me, and demonstrate the turf swindlers' method
of extracting money from the unsophisticated. Fully 25 per
cent of their "investors" are women, while the whole number
who contribute to their scheme is made up of persons who
would not be seen betting at a race track or pool room, but
who have consciences that will permit them to make money
"honestly or otherwise."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Here Are Plausible Arguments.</span></h4>

<p>This is one argument of a firm of so-called "Expert Handicappers"
of New York City, who bet on the races:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There has never been a week since we started in business
when we did not pay a dividend. The smallest dividend we
have ever paid for any one week was $6.50 for every $100
invested. We average about $9.50 per week on each $100."</p>

<p>"An investment with us is safer and brings better returns
than bookmaking or any other form of speculation."</p>
</div>

<p>Here is an argument of a firm of so-called "Turf Commissioners"
of San Francisco, which claimed to be betting on
the races, guaranteeing 4 per cent weekly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is no kind of speculation that affords so great an
opportunity for making money rapidly on a small capital as
playing the races on a business-like and systematic basis. Our
average weekly profits usually range from 4 to 8 per cent."</p>
</div>

<p>Another argument, that of a so-called "Bookmaker" of St.
Louis, who guarantees 5 per cent weekly dividends to investors:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We make books and allow the betting public to place the
money. The man who bets has one horse running for him&mdash;the
bookmaker has the rest. For this reason the odds are all
in favor of the bookmaker and if he understands his business
he is certain to make money."</p>
</div>

<p>Argument of a firm of so-called "Turf Commissioners" of
Chicago, who claim to make books on the races:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our plan insures a steady income on a small capital, such
as no other company offers, and far eclipses any mining, oil,
or other stock investment."</p>
</div>

<p>Argument of so-called racing stable concern of St. Louis,
guaranteeing 3 per cent per week to investors of $50 and upward:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We have a large stable of race horses, which we run at all
tracks, winter and summer; we make books wherever racing is
conducted, and the proposition we manage pays so well because
we know how to run it to that end."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the variants of the old turf scheme is the venerable
"Two-Horse Special," a fraud that is so old that its whiskers
drag about its knees. Here is a sample of the two-horse literature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">"MY TWO-HORSE SPECIAL PLAN."<br />
(Send this slip with remittance.)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">No Account Received of Less Than $50.</span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">George F. Stone</span>,<br />
<span class="i2">Turf Specialist.</span><br />
Brooklyn, N. Y.<br />
</p>

<p>I hand you ........ Dollars to be used by you
in speculating for me, according to your TWO-HORSE WIRE
plan of Turf Speculation. You are to play one-fifth of the
amount of capital on each special, placing the money to win
and also for place. You are to mail for me your selections
each day, mailing the same NOT LATER than 1 P. M. You
agree to operate the account, MAKING NO CHARGE until
winnings equal capital invested. After that 20 per cent of all
winnings you are to deduct, and send me the balance by money
order, with statement, each week. I can close my account
and withdraw any balance due me on demand. My liability
is strictly limited to above amount.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Police, Aroused by Turf Swindlers, Raid and Close
Up Their Places.</span></h4>

<p>Detective Wooldridge led the officers on February 23, 1900,
when the following concerns were raided and closed up:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">Co-Operative Trust Company, 80 and 84 Adam street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Turf Investment Company, 84 Adams street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Inter-Ocean Commission Company, 66 Wabash avenue.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Security Savings Company, Madison street and Fifth avenue.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Investors' Protective Association, 510 Realty Building.</li>

<li class="ifrst">D. W. Moody, 182 and 184 Dearborn street.</li>
</ul>


<p>The papers, books and "big-dividend" circulars of these concerns
filled several wagons. The police estimated that over
$500,000 had been lost by the investors in these concerns, which,
notwithstanding some of the high-sounding names adopted by
them, were all turf swindlers. Raid after raid has resulted in
practically ridding Chicago of these vampires, but they seem
to thrive wherever they are permitted to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>


<h3>FAKE TURFMEN INDICTED.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>Gambling and Bookmaking Charged Against the "Get-Rich-Quick"
Syndicates, Including Bennett's.</b></p>

<p>True bills were voted against proprietors of "get-rich-quick"
turf concerns by the grand jury. Indictments were returned in
court, and capiases for the arrest of the accused persons placed
in the hands of the sheriff. Those against whom bills were
voted are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Frank E. Stone, alias Eddie Dunne, Security Savings Society,
for bookmaking. W. R. Bennett, Security Savings Society,
for bookmaking. W. I Bennett, Security Savings Society,
for bookmaking. D. W. Moody, Security Savings Society, for
bookmaking. Louis Morrison, alias L. M. Morrison, Co-Operative
Trust Company, for bookmaking. Edwin E. Farley, for
keeping a common gaming house and poolroom. Charles Carroll,
for keeping a common gaming house and poolroom. J. W.
Turner, alias J. W. Taylor, for keeping a common gaming house
and poolroom. Miss S. Beck, stenographer for W. R. Bennett,
for bookmaking.</p>
</div>

<p>One puzzling feature of the prosecution of the turf people
is that although the bills accuse them of keeping common
gaming houses and operating poolrooms, officers and lawyers
interested in the cases say the promoters of the concerns never
really attempted to win their advertised profits by betting on
the races. It has been alleged that not one of them speculated
with deposits, but simply sent dividends back to investors out
of their own money. It is now suggested that the accused
persons will either have to admit they were gambling or confess
that their alluring statements about winnings on the
race tracks were glittering frauds.</p>

<p>The turf swindle was prosperous until February, 1903, when
the crash among the St. Louis contingent precipitated a "run"
on all of the concerns then in operation. As it was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
policy of the swindlers to pay, they either closed their doors
and fled or the police conveniently interfered with their business.</p>

<p>Prior to the crash at St. Louis there were several notable
failures and disappearances. On July 9, 1902, the Al Fetzer
Co., of Hammond, Ind., "failed," and about a week prior Turf
Commissioner W. W. O'Hara, of Cincinnati, absconded. Both
of these events shattered many dreams of riches. In the Fetzer
case heavy rains were said to have broken the sure-thing combination
by which the company was to win fortunes from
bookmakers on the race tracks.</p>

<p>The amounts lost by the credulous investors in Fetzer's
scheme, which, it was declared, "could not lose," reached into
the hundreds of thousands. The towns that suffered the most
were Hammond, Ind., and Appleton, Wis. It was reported
that the people of the latter town had suffered to the extent
of $50,000, and dozens of small cities are believed to have
fared almost as badly.</p>

<p>The clients of the concern in Appleton included a number of
well-known business men and people of all classes. They lost
from $25 to $200 each. A poor widow who had put in all
her savings was left penniless and was obliged to seek aid from
the city authorities.</p>

<p>Fetzer conducted a large part of his business through the
mails. He advertised extensively in the newspapers and found
many who were willing to "play the game." Dividends of $5
a week for $100 invested were promised and were paid punctually
up to about July 1, 1902. He said he had a system of
playing the races that could not be beaten, and the success
of the early investors convinced the doubting ones that his
system was all right. The information of the "snap" spread
rapidly and Fetzer's business increased accordingly. No one
thought that dividends of 260 per cent were improbable when
they read of the "long shots" that won races on the Chicago
tracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>Fetzer attributed the downfall of his business to the rainy
weather and said that he had been unsuccessful in picking
"mudders." His system of betting, which was to make everyone
rich by the end of the summer, went to pieces with each
succeeding thunder shower, and the investors received the
doleful information that the company had lost its own capital,
as well as the money entrusted to it.</p>

<p>An investigation into the affairs of O'Hara at Cincinnati
revealed a state of affairs almost beyond belief. More than
4,000 letters which were received within a week after O'Hara's
disappearance were opened. They were from every state in the
country, and many were from Canada. Amounts from $5 to
$500 in checks and mail and express orders were enclosed. The
total amount of the money in the letters opened was $5,518,
and Inspector Holmes stated that O'Hara got away with $7,500
which came in the mail the same week, making a total of
over $12,000 for one week's business. O'Hara's books showed
that from July, 1900, when he commenced operations, until
he skipped out in June, 1902, he had received from credulous
"investors" the enormous sum of $465,000.</p>

<p>The inevitable crash came early in February, 1903, and
the police and grand juries at Chicago, St. Louis, New York
and other cities got busy, but the money had been transferred
to the pockets of the swindlers, who had the choice of paying
lawyers and possible fines or traveling in foreign climes until
the excitement blew over.</p>

<p>February, 1903, Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge raided and
closed the following named turf investment companies in
Chicago:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li class="ifrst">H. B. Blackstone, E. J. Arnold, 95 Dearborn street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Harry Brolaski, "Brolaski &amp; Co.," 356 Dearborn street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Henry Thompson, "Brolaski &amp; Co.," 356 Dearborn street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Mattie Woodin, "Benedict &amp; Co.," 225 Dearborn street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">M. J. Beck, "Benedict &amp; Co.," 225 Dearborn street.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></li>

<li class="ifrst">W. J. Mason, "Benedict &amp; Co.," 225 Dearborn street.</li>

<li class="ifrst">"Mid-Continent," 185 Dearborn street.</li>
</ul>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prey on Chicago Teachers.</span></h4>

<p>From papers found in the Mid-Continent offices it appears
this company had been doing a loan as well as an investment
business. A letter addressed to Chicago school teachers invited
deposits for investment on which 2-1/2 per cent monthly interest
was guaranteed.</p>

<p>If the teachers needed money it was offered them at 3 per
cent a month. The company's methods and those of the banks
were compared in the letter, to the disadvantage of the banks.</p>

<p>Medical students, stenographers, maids in hotels, women of
various classes, farmers in many sections of the country and
hundreds of men in different employments in the city were
disclosed as the dupes.</p>

<p>The following telegram from St. Louis to a Chicago
paper briefly outlines the situation on the second day of the
raiding there:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 11, 1903.&mdash;Runs were made on the E. J.
Arnold Turf Investment Company, the International Investment
Company, The Christie Investment Company and John J. Ryan
&amp; Co. yesterday by hundreds of men and women who during the
last six months have invested their savings with these co-operative
bookmaking concerns in the hope of enormous profits. The
International and Christie companies paid all the stockholders
who appeared, at first. Then they decamped.</p>

<p>Arnold &amp; Co., in accordance with their announcement which
caused the panic among the "turf speculators" yesterday, refused
to pay back any stock certificates, although still claiming to be
perfectly solvent, and determined to pay the usual weekly dividends
until affairs of the company are wound up.</p>

<p>At the offices of John J. Ryan, owner of the Newport (Ky.)
Race Track, a riot was averted by the presence of the police;
and the excited investors, who were reminded that their stock
certificates are payable only on thirty days' notice, went off in
a state of rage and anxiety at once amusing and pitiful.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">How Arnold Inspired Confidence.</span></h4>

<p>Arnold was a wise one. He knew how to work the game.
First he sent to New York and bought the famous race horse
Gold Heels. This horse had won many of the great Eastern
classics. He broke a tendon and was useless, but Arnold's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
investors did not know that. They would swear by Gold Heels.
Then he caused his "bank" to issue a letter along the following
lines:</p>

<p>The disaster was brought about by the appointment of
a committee by the Missouri legislature to investigate the
"get-rich-quick" situation. St. Louis had become the haven
of every conceivable class of swindlers, who swarmed there
in such numbers that the legislature deemed it wise to look
into the matter. What motive inspired it to take this action
was a mystery. Sufficient, however, to observe that when it
came to following out its own recommendation to pass laws
that would drive the "get-rich-quick" companies of all kinds
out of the state something stopped the legislation.</p>

<p>The investigation of the "get-rich-quick" concerns in Missouri
by the State Senate Committee resulted in an elaborate
report, which was presented March 3, 1903. This report had
the following to say of the turf investment companies:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"These institutions are of modern origin. The pioneer in
this field, especially in this state, seems to have been E. J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
Arnold &amp; Co. Then followed Ryan &amp; Co., the International,
The Christian Syndicate, Brolaski, Thomas Walsh, Maxim-Gay
and others.</p>

<p>"These concerns were presumably prosperous until the examination
which was begun by the grand jury, instigated by
the circuit attorney of St. Louis, Hon. Joseph W. Folk, and
your present committee. When the crash came, company after
company closed its doors or refused to pay back to depositors
on demand, and upon examination of these companies, we
found them to be mere shells, with little or no money or available
assets on hand, and the millions of dollars handled by
them either paid out in dividends, squandered and gambled
away on race tracks, or absorbed by the officers and managers
of the said companies.</p>

<p>"The evidence discloses the fact that E. J. Arnold is supposed
to be in Mexico, the books of said company being in the
hands of the grand jury. So far as the search under legal
process has developed, no assets of Arnold &amp; Co., except a stock
farm and stock thereon, office furniture and fixtures, and a
few hundred dollars in cash, were found.</p>

<p>"Ryan &amp; Company claim that they have on hand $200,000,
which has been attached and garnisheed, in the hands of the
depositories, and the same process has been used to take possession
of the real estate holdings and other personal property.</p>

<p>"George A. Dice, inspector of the postoffice, in charge of
the St. Louis department, testified that he had made an examination
of E. J. Arnold &amp; Co. and John J. Ryan &amp; Co.,
and that on their showing Arnold &amp; Co. had on hand $160,000
more assets than their liabilities; that two different examinations
of these concerns were made by him and his deputies,
and that in the last report of November and December, 1902,
his report to the department recommended that they be cited
to appear before the department and answer as to their liability
for criminal use of the mails, and that so far as his report
went they were notified that there was a case pending against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
them; that the ruling of the department was not in accordance
with his recommendation; that from the evidence it appears
that the department at Washington, by some process or
other unknown to your committee, overruled the recommendations
of the inspector, dismissed the cases pending against these
companies, and they were allowed to proceed with their process
of absorbing the people's money. Had the department at
Washington acted promptly and properly upon the recommendation
of the inspector, millions of dollars would have been
saved to the people of the State of Missouri and other states.</p>

<p>"In order to protect the people who are attracted by the
fair promises and the payment of extraordinary profits or
dividends, and to prohibit the improper and vicious misapplication
and absorption of the money of the people who
confide in the representation of investment companies, your
committee recommends that a law be passed which will prohibit
the doing of business by said turf investment companies
or other like institutions in this state."</p>
</div>

<p>If one should moralize on the turf swindles it would only be
to repeat the old story&mdash;avarice. Nothing else explains why
they are permitted to flourish and rob, and then a newspaper
story and no more.</p>

<p>Justice, blind and decrepit, is unable to scale the insurmountable
barrier of the swindlers' "bank roll." But there is still
hope, for from Washington we hear from day to day that another
boodler has been landed in the grand jury net&mdash;thanks
to President Roosevelt, who, if he knew all, would do more.</p>

<p>When the last paragraph was written the finale had not been
reached. But the strong arm of the federal government has
at last been felt and the turf investment companies are no
more. It is impossible for even the veriest sucker to be taken
in by them any more, and their literature would be barred
from the mails in an instant. It is all over with the turf
investment companies. "<em class="italic">Requiescat in pace.</em>" May they rest
in peace.</p>

<h3>A MOST DANGEROUS FORM OF RASCALITY.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>Drugs Worth $30,000 Seized.</b></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center"><b>War on Makers of Imitations of Medicines Begun by the
Chicago Police in Charge of Detective
Clifton R. Wooldridge.</b></p>


<p>In all the history of fraud, imposture and graft, there is no
story to parallel that of the "fake drug clique." There is no
means of finding out how many thousands of lives are annually
sacrificed in consequence of its nefarious practices, and
the strong arm of the law while it can reach out and prevent
further crime, can not call back to life those who have been
offered up on the altar of greed.</p>

<p>Sensational raids made in the effort to clear Chicago of its
numerous "Fake" patent medicine concerns, occurred on the
morning of Nov. 29, 1904.</p>

<p>The raids followed a long conference between Chief of Police
Francis O'Neill and Col. James E. Stuart, Chief Inspector of
Chicago Postal Department, and for the first time in the history
of the city, the Federal and City forces worked in unison.
They decided that Chicago should be cleared of "Fake" Patent
Medicine Concerns which for years had been using the mails
to defraud hundreds of thousands of sick and weak persons.</p>

<p>George G. Kimball, U. S. Inspector of Mails, and Detective
Clifton R. Wooldridge were assigned to gather the evidence and
prepare the cases for prosecution. The work was no easy
task. Both officers went about the work of gathering the evidence
in a thoroughly systematic manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>Inspector Kimball discovered the mails were employed extensively
by the agents in disposing of their spurious drugs.
Investigation proved that large orders were sent to small suburban
towns and cities weekly. The correspondence, circulars
and goods were secured.</p>

<p>The breaking up of the drug ring, however, was a delicate
task. It was strongly backed financially, and it was aided and
abetted, throughout the United States, by political rings galore.
Chicago was the headquarters, and it was natural that to
the police department of this city, ever-famed for its hatred
of "grafts" big and little, should fall the lot of exterminating
the traffic.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge gathered the information in Chicago,
the names of the firms, location and the men who owned them.</p>

<p>The men are charged with making and selling a spurious
preparation of aristol, a product made in Germany, and valued
as a substitute for iodoform. Their products were represented
as genuine, were said to differ from those handled by the wholesale
drug trade, only in the fact that they were imported from
Canada and England instead of from Germany.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the things discovered in the course of the
investigation by Detective C. R. Wooldridge. The statements are
printed from an interview with the great detective.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"As we have progressed the work has broadened and grown
to proportions never anticipated at the start. Among the
goods seized were found boxes, the labels of which bore the
chemical name and formula of trional, and which gave an
exact description of the chemical and physical properties of
trional and the medicinal indications of this drug.</p>

<p>"On examination it was found that these boxes contained
pure acetanilid. The dosage of drugs recommended upon the
label was fifteen to twenty grains, and it was stated 'that night
sweats of phthisis are promptly arrested by eight grains."</p>

<p>"I am informed that it is within the professional knowledge
of every druggist as well as every physician that the substitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
grain for grain, of acetanilid, for trional, is a most
reprehensible fraud, which might cause the death of the patient
to whom the drug was administered.</p>

<p>"As indicating the commercial fraud connected with this
substitution, it should be stated that the price charged for
this drug by the defendants in this case, as shown by the price
list, was 95 cents per ounce, commercial value of acetanilid
is one and one half cents per ounce.</p>

<p>"But by far the largest fraud found was in the counterfeit
label business. There were 2,400 metal caps for bottles stamped
with the name of a Swiss manufacturer. There were also
labels purporting to be German or Swiss labels. A number
of half filled bottles, waiting for the adulterants, showed conclusively
the use to which these labels were to be put.</p>

<p>"We were fortunate enough to find certain cards and bills
in this place indicating that the makers of these metal caps
and labels had never been nearer Switzerland or Germany than
Clark and Harrison streets. Acting upon this information we
secured evidence that these articles were made in Chicago and
never imported.</p>

<p>"These entire preparations including the mixing, boxing,
labeling and placing upon the market was done by these parties
here in Chicago, and the goods, much of it undoubtedly,
placed in the hands of innocent purchasers, who were deceived
by the external appearance of genuineness, into purchasing the
adulterated and fraudulent goods, without analysis or investigation
of any kind.</p>

<p>"The great public, the individuals who use these drugs when
prescribed by their physician, are themselves in total ignorance
of the fact, not only that they have defrauded and cheated, but
perhaps placed in jeopardy of their lives.</p>

<p>"There were found among these boxes seized, certain receptacles
which bore labels stating that aristol was contained therein.
On examination by reputable chemists at the Columbus
Laboratories, the powder in these boxes was found to be fullers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
earth, colored with oxide of iron, not containing a single trace
of aristol. The aristol, which was quoted on the price lists
as 'equal to Bayer's' was sold at 80 cents per ounce, at which
almost a ton of fullers earth and oxide of iron could be
purchased.</p>

<p>"The evidence was procured and chemical tests made which
proved the presence of alien matter in the prescriptions which
called for pure drugs. In nearly 20 per cent of the samples
obtained there was not even a trace of the drug called for in
the prescription; Acetanilid as a substitute for trional-aristol,
which is an antiseptic wash much used by surgeons.</p>

<p>"Prescriptions were sent to 139 druggists signed by Dr. J.
Scott Brown, calling for pure aristol. Dr. J. A. Wesener of the
Columbus Laboratories conducted the tests.</p>
</div>

<h3>WHAT THE TEST SHOWED.</h3>

<p class="center">(The results) Dr. Wesener showed the following:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="results">
<tr><td align="right">23 prescriptions</td><td align="right">No trace of aristol</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">66 prescriptions</td><td align="right">80 per cent impurity</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">10 prescriptions</td><td align="right">20 per cent impurity</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">9 prescriptions</td><td align="right">10 per cent impurity</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">31 prescriptions</td><td align="right">pure</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Druggists have been misled into purchasing this substitute
for aristol by unscrupulous salesmen, who have palmed off on
them a substance which in many cases is nothing more than
'fuller's earth,' said Dr. Wesener. This stuff was sold to
them cheap.</p>

<p>"The druggist can have no excuse for selling this stuff, which
is injurious, because it is an easy matter for him to test it
to find out whether it is aristol or not. Aristol is soluble in
either, and makes a dark brown solution. Some of the powder
which we have obtained on these prescriptions is not soluble at
all. We have not completed the chemical analysis of all the
precipitates, but those which we have tried consist of chalk
mixed with an iron oxide to give it the color, or some other
mineral substance."</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p>The two leading imitations are as follows: Spurious preparation
of aristol, and an imitation of triethylate which is a
substitute for trional.</p>

<p>Aristol sells at $1.85 an ounce and triethylate retails at $1.50
an ounce. The cost of manufacturing the two imitations is
about 2 cents an ounce.</p>


<h3>DANGER TO THE PATIENT.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The adulteration of aristol is liable to be fraught with
serious consequences to the patient. It is extremely dangerous
to introduce a mineral substance into an open wound, and many
surgeons who have used this adulterated antiseptic, having
bought it in good faith for the pure drug, have been at a loss
to know why the wounds have suppurated. It is possible this
adulterated drug may have caused numberless cases of blood
poison with consequent loss of life."</p>
</div>

<h3>HASTENED McKINLEY'S DEATH.</h3>

<p>It is even whispered that one of the products sold by this
gang as a counterfeit of a standard article hastened the death
of President William McKinley. The story goes that when
the physicians sent to the nearest drug store for a certain kind
of medicine they were given a substance which resembled it in
every way but which was spurious. It is said the drug had
exactly the opposite effect upon the president from what the
doctors had reason to suppose it would have. Some there are
who even declare that the application of the genuine article
at that critical time would have saved the life of William
McKinley.</p>

<p>Otta G. Stoltz, druggist at 60 Rush street, Chicago, Ill.,
assisted by his porter, manufactured the spurious drugs in his
basement for E. A. Kuehmsted.</p>

<p>In manufacturing the standard remedy of aristol, he used
fifty per cent of various ingredients, and fifty per cent of
rosin. It was called "Thymistol, manufactured by the Mexican
Chemical Company," and substituted for aristol. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
was no such a company in Mexico. The goods, boxes and
labels were made in Chicago, Illinois, and the stuff was sold
to the druggists for one half the price of the genuine aristol.</p>

<p>The gang was ostensibly engaged in selling to the retail drug
trade infringements of a large number of patented drugs, manufactured
in Germany. Their products were represented to be
genuine, differing from those handled by the legitimate wholesale
drug trade only in the fact that they were imported by
them direct from Canada and England, thereby evading payment
of royalty to the American patentees. As a matter of fact,
the peddlers used the cry of monopoly under the patents merely
as a pretext for ingratiating themselves with the retail druggists,
and then foisted upon them many adulterated and spurious
imitations of the imported preparations. The drugs imitated
are standard medical preparations, dispensed on physician's
prescription by every retail pharmacist. These remedies
are in so general use that at least one-half the prescriptions
written by physicians call for one or other of them.</p>

of other bogus goods for over three years. I have never had
the pleasure of selling you any of them. I should very much
like to do so, and feel that I can give you satisfaction both
in goods and prices.</p>

<p>Some time ago I perfected arrangements to get my supplies
direct from Europe, where the supply is not so limited as in
Canada, and I can do much better in price.</p>

<p>The enclosed list gives my complete line. All items with
prices attached I have in stock and can supply without delay.
Other items are continually arriving.</p>

<p>The prices I have made you are, I think, exceptionally low,
and I trust they will induce you to give me a trial. Express

<h3>THE STATE LAWS COVERING THE FRAUDULENT
ADULTERATION OF DRUGS AND MEDICINES
FOR THE PURPOSE OF SALE,
READS AS FOLLOWS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Section 10, Chapter 38 of Hurd's Revised Statutes of Illinois
for 1903. Whoever fraudulently adulterates, for the purpose
of sale, any drug or medicine, or sells or offers or keeps
for sale any fraudulently adulterated drug or medicine, knowing
the same to be adulterated, shall be confined in the County
Jail not exceeding one year, or fined not exceeding $1,000, and
such adulterated drugs and medicines shall be forfeited and
destroyed."</p>
</div>

<p>After the great mass of evidence had been gathered it was
submitted to the Chief of Police, Francis O'Neill, who instructed
Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge to lay the matter before
John K. Prindiville, Justice of Peace, and if he would issue
warrants to go ahead and search the premises and make arrest.</p>

<p>Desk Sergeant Mike White looked upon as an expert by the
police Department drew the complaints and warrants which
were duly signed and a detail of 20 picked men was assigned to
Detective Wooldridge with instructions to go ahead, and on
Oct. 29, 1904, they were divided into four squads and they
swooped down on the five Medicine concerns at one time without
giving them any warning.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the parties arrested:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>W. G. Nay, alias S. B. Soper, 1452 Fulton street; over
$2,000 worth of spurious stuff seized. Nay and wife arrested.</p>

<p>Burtis B. M'Cann, alias George A. Barton, 6113 Madison
avenue, $2,500 worth of stuff seized. McCann arrested.</p>

<p>J. J. Dean, 6123 Ellis avenue; $5,000 worth of spurious
medicines seized; Dean and wife arrested.</p>

<p>J. N. Levy, 359 Dearborn street; $500 worth seized.</p>

<p>Edward A. Kuehmsted, 6323 Ingleside avenue, and Isabella
Kuehmsted were arrested; over $12,000 worth of spurious drugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
were seized by Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge, Sergeant William
M. McGrath, Sergeant Thomas Fitzpatrick, Officers Terence
N. Kelly, Mathew J. Reilly, Michael O'Neill, Thomas
Ready, Michael McGuire, August C. Dolan, Patrick Quinn,
Thomas Daly, Bernard Conway.</p>
</div>

<p>V. Goldberg, a partner of Edward Kuehmsted, appeared
on the scene and tried to prevent the officers from taking
the goods. He was locked up on the charge of disorderly
conduct and on the following morning entered a plea of guilty
before Justice John R. Caverly and was fined $1 and cost.
John G. Campbell, alleged attorney for Edward A. Kuehmsted,
appeared upon the scene and tried to force his way into
the house while the drug was being removed. He also tried
to prevent the officers from taking the drugs and threatened to
whip them, pulled his coat off and assaulted Detective Wooldridge.
He too was sent to the Harrison Street Station and
locked up.</p>

<p>The prisoners arrested in the raid were sent to the Harrison
Street Police Station together with eleven wagonloads of drugs
seized, which were valued at $30,000.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the prisoners and the drugs, a United
States warrant was served upon them, charging the defendants
with using the mails to defraud, also a duces tecum subpoena
was served for the drugs seized in the raid to be brought into
the United States court forthwith, was served upon Detective
Wooldridge, and other officers by United States Marshal.</p>

<p>The two ex-convicts were Levy, who was also known under
the aliases of Charles Meyers, R. Waldron, and R. Cassat and
George Edwards. Under the latter name he served a year in
Joliet. Hass was the other ex-convict. His Sing Sing number
was B 5574. Yet under the administration of the law under
the justice shop system these men, who sold chalk and water
mixed with idorn oxides for an antiseptic, finally managed
to get out of the clutches of the law on a compromise adjudication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
concerning which the State's Attorney alone knew the
details.</p>

<p>Then the insolent vendors of fake drugs thought they saw a
chance to get back at the officers of the law. They found a nice
little loop-hole in the fact that when the raids were made a
few chemicals, which were not contraband had been seized, in
the rush and scurry of the raid.</p>

<p>Therefore a suit was brought against Detective Clifton R.
Wooldridge, Charles M. Carr, editor of the N. A. R. D. Notes,
a police publication, Henry D. Morton, Chief of Police Francis
O'Neill, the Farbenfabriken Co. and Wooten. The suit called
for heavy damages. After going over the evidence the court
of first resort awarded damages of $1.00. Rather than be put
to the cost of an appeal this $1.00 was paid by the defendants.</p>

<p>But the business of vending fake drugs in the city of Chicago
had been broken up and the city made unsafe for this most detestable
class of swindlers, who prey upon the sick and wounded
and endanger human life by the sale of their nostrums. "It was
worth $1.00 to put the rascally crew out of business," said Detective
Wooldridge afterward in discussing the matter. "It
is surely worth a dollar to a man to know that he has been instrumental
in saving thousands of human lives." And there
the matter rested.</p>

at this time, their geographical distribution marked by the
boundaries of the country.</p>

<p>For each of these 1,000 shops an average of $100 a day gross
income is necessary to meet its expenses, chief of which are
for wire and ticker service and blackboard writers.</p>

<p>Thus, in order that 1,000 of these shops may live and remain
open, they must have $100 a day each, which, in a year of 300
days, means an income of $300,000,000 annually. Many of
these bucket shops fail for lack of money, while others "fail"
in order that they may keep the money of the investor. While
$100,000 a day as the losses of the people in the illegitimate
speculation in grain is very conservative, one must add another
$100,000 a day as tribute which the gullible pay to the
fake "get-rich-quick" and kindred sharper concerns of the
country.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"Speculation" an Unmeaning Term.</span></h3>

<p>Yet with this $100,000 a day going into the hopper of frenzied
speculation of all kinds, Bradstreet's for the year 1907
showed business failures from speculation as one-eighth of 1
per cent of the total failures of the country.</p>

<p>Whatever may be Bradstreet's definition of the word "speculation,"
as used in his lists, the word to the average business
man who knows whereof he talks is as unmeaning as any other
in the business dictionary. Suppose a man somewhere in a
country town loses money in any speculative venture anywhere
under the sun. If it is a few dollars only, he may not speak of
it at all. If it is enough to embarrass him, perhaps he may
have to speak. Under these circumstances the best possible
thing to do is to explain that he lost it "on the Chicago Board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
of Trade." If he has no credit at stake in the matter, and is
sore, he may yell murder over his losses "on the board." But
hundreds of such men have lost their money in bucket shops,
and scores of them have lost it at poker or some other gambling
game.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"Board of Trade" Falsely Blamed.</span></h3>

<p>Every little while a banker somewhere goes wrong with funds
that are intrusted to him, and in the telling of the story the
"Chicago Board of Trade" is the secret of his undoing.</p>

<p>One of the marked cases of the kind was that of the Aurora
banker who defalcated with $90,000, "lost on the Board of
Trade."</p>

<p>But when the story was run down it was discovered that his
money was lost in a bucket shop in Hammond, Ind., which had
been driven out of Chicago through the efforts of the Chicago
Board.</p>

<p>When $100,000, at a conservative estimate, every day, is lost
by the American public in bucket shops, just the thing that
such a shop is "in being" should be of economic interest and
consideration.</p>

<p>Within the knowledge of tens of thousands of citizens some
acquaintance or person of whom they have had personal knowledge
has gone "broke" in grain speculation.</p>

<p>Yet to find a man who has lost his fortune on the race tracks
or in a gambling den is not at all an easy task.</p>

<p>Without a question the gambling losses in the bucket shop
are more serious in consequences the country over than the
losses in any other one kind of gaming, for the reason that the
man who could afford to confess losses at horse racing or at
cards may retain his character as a business man to a far greater
extent by having lost at a "little flyer in grain."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">What is a Bucket Shop.</span></h3>

<p>I have frequently been requested to define bucket shops&mdash;a
most difficult task, owing to the variety of disguises which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
assume and the outward similarity which they bear to legitimate
brokerage. The following definition covers the essential
features of bucket shops from the standpoint of an expert.</p>

<p>A bucket shop is an establishment conducted nominally and
ostensibly for the transaction of a grain, cotton or stock exchange
business.</p>

<p>The proprietor, with or without the consent of the patron,
takes one side of every deal that is made in his place, the patron
taking the other, no article being bought or sold in any public
market.</p>

<p>Bucket shops counterfeit the speculative trading on exchanges.</p>

<p>Continuous market quotations of an exchange are the essence,
the very sinew of the gambling business carried on in a
bucket shop, being used as dice are used, to determine the result
of a bet.</p>

<p>The market quotations posted in a bucket shop are exactly
similar to those posted in a legitimate broker's office, but they
are displayed for a different purpose. The broker posts the
quotations for the purpose of showing what the market has been
on the exchange as a matter of news.</p>

<p>The bucket shop posts them as the terms upon which its patrons
may make bets with the keeper. A bucket shop is destroyed
if it loses its supply of quotations.</p>

<p>Margins deposited with the bucket shop proprietor by the
patrons are nothing but the patrons' stakes to the wager, and
are appropriated by the proprietor when the fluctuations of the
price on the exchange whose quotations are the basis of the bet,
reach the limit of the deposit, one party (the proprietor) to the
bet acting as stakeholder. The commissions charged by the
bucket shopkeepers are odds in its favor, and necessary in order
to maintain their pretense of being legitimate brokers making
the transaction on an exchange.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ready to Make All Deals.</span></h3>

<p>The bucket shop proprietor is ready to make all deals offered
in any commodity that fluctuates in price. He may call himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
banker and broker, or commission merchant, or disguise his
business under the form of an incorporated enterprise or exchange.
But he is still a common gambler. The interest of
the proprietor of a bucket shop is at all times opposed to that
of his patrons, as the profits of the shop are measured by the
losses of the patrons.</p>

<p>Bucket shops should not be confounded with the great public
markets of the world, where buyer and seller, producer and consumer,
investor and speculator meet in legitimate trade; for
the pretended buying of millions of bushels of grain in bucket
shops will not add a fraction of a cent to the price of the
product of the farm, nor will the pretended selling of as much
increase the supplies of the consumer or lessen the cost of his
loaf a farthing. Nor should they be confounded with the offices
of legitimate brokers which they endeavor to imitate in appearance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Name Coined in London.</span></h3>

<p>The term "bucket shop," as now applied in the United
States, was first used in the late '70s. It was coined in London
fifty years ago, when it had absolutely no reference to any
species of speculation or gambling. Beer swillers from the
East Side (London) went from street to street with buckets,
draining every keg they came across and picking up cast-off
cigar butts. Arriving at a den they gathered for social amusement
around a table and passed the bucket as a loving cup,
each taking a "pull" as it came his way.</p>

<p>In the interval were smoking and rough jokes. The den came
to be called a bucket shop. Later the term was applied, both
in England and the United States, as a byword of reproach to
small places where grain and stock deals were counterfeited.</p>

<p>Yet the bucket shop is a gambling den par excellence, with
all the paraphernalia necessary for the deception of the unsuspecting.
One may place a $10 bet in the bucket shop, pay a
commission of 25 per cent to the "bucket shopper," who may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
so shuffle the "cards" that the bettor may have to lose, even
after he has won. As an example:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Game Neatly Fixed.</span></h3>

<p>The one thing absolutely necessary to the bucket shop are
quotations, never from a legitimate board of trade, but through
leased wires, or wire tappings, or from some other fake source.
For the instant that the "quotations" cannot be written upon
the blackboards the betting must cease. The bet of the customer
is that before a certain grain drops off a point against
him, it will advance a point or more in his favor, and the bucket
shopper takes the bet, holding the stake himself. Frequently
the bettor may realize that he has won a point, or two, or three,
and may insist upon the bucket shop selling for him. Perhaps
the victim lives at a distance from the shop and must write or
wire his "broker." He wires for the "broker" to sell, and
perhaps gets a message in reply to the effect that the market
must go much better than that; that he refuses to sacrifice his
patron's best interests in that way, and will hold on for the
certain rise. In most cases this patron is immensely flattered,
until within a few days the market is "off" again, wiping out
not only his profits, but his original margins as well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">How the Suckers Are Skinned.</span></h3>

<p>Or if on a certain day the customer takes advantage of a
rise in the commodity bet upon, and insists upon closing out
the deal, it is most frequently settled by the bucket shop upon
the lowest figure for the day. Occasionally, indeed, where a
bucket shop keeper has allowed one or more customers to "win"
a considerable figure from it through some untoward turn in
figures, the whole shop closes up and disappears, leaving the
victims no redress at law for the reason that they have left the
money voluntarily in the hands of the sharpers. Occasionally
the country branch office of one of these central bucket shops
may clean out a town of its currency until the scarcity of money
in the place may demoralize the every-day business of the
town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>That the man who tries to beat the bucket shop has an impossible
task in front of him in investigating the $10 bet, the
commonest in the shop. The man with the bill steps up to the
window and asks to buy ten shares of American Sugar at $110
a share, paying 25 per cent out of the $10 as commission.
Then, counting that the bucket shop might be as nearly straight
as such an institution can be, remember that the decline of
Sugar three-quarters of a point will wipe out the bettor's $10,
while for him to win another $10, Sugar will have to advance
to $111.25. In short, the customer is betting against a proposition
which will lose him $10 if Sugar declines 75 cents, while
to win $10 it must advance $1.25, in either case the bucket shop
holding his money and taking 25 cents in tolls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Other "Fakes" "Boost" the Game.</span></h3>

<p>In the machinations of the bucket shop interests and those
of kindred concerns that are garnering this $100,000 a day from
the American people, the fake trade journal has had much to
do; the fake mercantile agency, reporting extravagantly upon
the responsibility and wealth of the schemers, has played extensively
upon the credulity of men and women; fake banks
and bankers have come into existence for the completion of the
work of the others, and have been by no means the least in the
category of rascality; the whole aggregation has been lending
back and forth the "sucker lists," which is an interchangeable
lists of names and addresses of men and women who have
"bitten" at one scheme and may be promising of a rise to another
of different type under a new title.</p>

<p>On file in the office of a Chicago man of affairs at the present
moment is a series of interesting letters, which he shows
occasionally to a friend. These letters are especially eloquent
of a spirit of investment which is in the country today and
which prompts the "biting" at almost any sort of flaunting announcement
of quick riches. The letters are from a young man
holding an official job under the government at Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Big Dividend Promises False.</span></h3>

<p>The first letter is apologetic for reminding the addressee
that he is an old friend of the writer's family; but it recites
that the young man has about $200 in bank which he has saved
from his salary, and which he is disposed to invest with a
certain company if his friend in Chicago thinks the prospects
are in line with good business and responsibility.</p>

<p>Evidently the Chicago man does not regard the concern as
dependable, for the next letter expresses thanks for saving the
writer loss, but asks a further question of a concern that promises
20 per cent a month on cash investments in grain.</p>

<p>The third letter, recognizing all that the old friend from
Chicago has done, explains that he has only a fair salary from
which it is hard to save much money, and this fact has led him
to the necessity of considering an investment of his savings
that promise large returns, and yet at the same time promise
the maximum of safety. Having established his reasons for
such ventures, he suggests to the friend: "Perhaps you can
answer all I want to know in a single reply. 'Are any of these
concerns promising dividends of 50 per cent and such to be
depended on'?"</p>

<p>And the Chicago man's letter, in substance, reads: "No!"</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"Outsider" Has No Chance.</span></h3>

<p>Speculation, for the most part, as in the case of this young
man, means for the average intelligence a possibility for placing
money in a side line where quick and profitable returns
may be expected, wholly independent of the person's occupation.
To the man who knows what the best of the speculative
market is, the necessity for all of the time and attention and
best judgment of the speculator is imperative. It is a business
in which only the best business methods succeed.</p>

<p>On the boards of trade the commission merchants may be
wholly apart from any risk in even the legitimate trading, taking
the commission of one-eighth of a cent a bushel in buying
and selling. On the Board of Trade of Chicago the designated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
leading speculative articles, in their order, are wheat, corn,
oats, rye, barley, mess pork, lard, short ribs, live hogs and
cotton.</p>

<p>A year's grain crop may be 650,000,000 bushels of wheat,
2,500,000,000 bushels of corn, 900,000,000 bushels of oats,
150,000,000 bushels of barley, and 30,000,000 bushels of rye.</p>

<p>Bucket shops have been condemned by statutes as criminal
and pernicious in many states in the Union, but anti-bucket
shop laws are rarely enforced by public servants whose duty it
is to enforce them. Prosecutions thus far, except in Illinois,
have been left to private citizens or associations for the suppression
of gambling.</p>

<p>The "bucket shop" has, within a few years past, sprung from
comparative inconsequence into an institution of formidable
wealth and threatening proportions. There are nearly a thousand
in the United States. Every large city in the west has at
least one. Having banded together in a strong combination
they sneer at legislation. Opulent and powerful they scoff at
antagonistic public opinion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">On Level with Lottery and Faro Bank.</span></h3>

<p>The "bucket shop," like the lottery and the faro bank, finds
its profits in its customers' losses. If its patrons "buy" wheat
and wheat goes up, the "bucket shop" loses.</p>

<p>Many a bucket shop commission merchant would hardly
know wheat from oats, and none of their grain and produce
"exchanges" ever had a sample bag on its counters. Their
transactions are wagers and their existence is an incitement to
gambling under the guise of commercial transactions. The
pernicious influences of the gaming house are, in the bucket
shop, surrounded by the allurement of a cloak of respectability
and the assumption of business methods.</p>

<p>The legitimate exchange is a huge time and labor saving machine.
Its benefits are universal. While its privileges are valuable
they have been rendered so only by hard work, and its
members are entitled to the protection of the state against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
thieves. The "bucket shop" is a thief. The quotations upon
which the "bucket shop" trades are the product of the labor
and intelligence and information of the exchange. The exchange
gathers its news at great cost from all over the globe
and disseminates it for public advantage. But its quotations
should be its own property. They are the direct product of its
energy, its foresight and its business sagacity.</p>

<p>The "bucket shop," at no parallel cost, usurps the functions
of the exchange and endeavors to secure for itself the returns
for a labor performed by others. Were it to use honorable
methods with its patrons it would be a dishonorable institution.
Using the methods it does, the "bucket shop" is twice
dishonored.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, all other forms of gambling or swindling
are commonplace and comparatively innocent when compared
to the "bucket shop" which has caused more moral
wrecks, more dismantled fortunes and made more of the innocent
suffer than any other agency of diabolism. Just why so
brazen an iniquity in the guise of speculation should be allowed
to exist it is difficult to explain.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Open Gambling Under Ban.</span></h3>

<p>Open gambling has been placed under the ban of civic reform.
While the policy shop, the lottery and other less dangerous
methods of swindling have been effectively stamped out
of most cities, the "bucket shop tiger" continues to rend the
ambitions of young and old, dragging them down to forgery,
embezzlement, suicide,&mdash;or that which is quite as bad,&mdash;broken
spirit for legitimate endeavor. Under the circumstances the
sympathy of the public should be with the movement to drive
"bucket shops" out of business, to close them along with all
other gambling institutions.</p>

<p>It is time that something was done to check the growing evil
of gambling on produce, cotton and stock exchange quotations.
A beginning has been made, but the movement has not gone far
enough. These excrescences on the body politic have multiplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
rapidly and so dangerously near do they come to being popular
that the mercantile community owes it to itself to apply the
knife at once.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is no form of gambling more disastrous to
the player than "bucket shop" gambling. Its semi-respectability
and likeness in many outward features to regular and
reputable commission houses makes it the most insidious of all
temptations to the young speculator and aspirant for wealth.
It is the open door to ruin.</p>

<div class="caption">THAT NEW LEAF</div>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Open Door to Ruin.</span></h3>

<p>Men do not blush at being seen in a "bucket shop" as they
would if caught in a faro bank or poker room though they are
drawn thither by the same passion for gambling that takes
them to the regular gambling den. The "bucket shop" successfully
carries on a worse swindling game than the "blacklegs."
The wealth the chief "bucket shop" men of the country have
acquired proves this. Men can be pointed out in Chicago, New
York and other cities of the country who have amassed fortunes
at the business while their thousands of victims are impoverished
and ruined.</p>

<p>Persons desiring to speculate or invest can avoid "bucket
shops" and "fake" brokers by making a preliminary and independent
investigation into the character of the broker and the
merits of the enterprise. If they accept the statements and
references of promoters of schemes without making such investigations
they are not entitled to sympathy if they are robbed.</p>

<p>Legitimate brokers do not resort to sensational advertising;
they do not guarantee profits; nor do they solicit funds to invest
on their judgment. The functions of a broker or commission
merchant are to receive and execute the order of his
customers. When he offers to do more (except in the way of
giving market news, advice or conservative opinions) he should
be avoided. Promoters of pools and syndicates and disseminators
of advance information should be carefully avoided.</p>

<h2><a id="ON_SURE_THINGS">ON "SURE THINGS."</a></h2>

<h3>HOW TO LEARN THEIR REAL CHARACTER.</h3>


<p>The cleverness and boldness with which the up-to-date investment
swindler plies his craft are almost incredible. Wherever
you find a fraudulent scheme you will find both of these
elements present in some degree&mdash;but the comparative proportion
of one to the other is generally determined by the element
of time of operation.</p>

<p>For example, if the projectors of a scheme are old hands at
the game and have established records of the wrong sort, then
the idea of quick results is not only attractive, but often imperative.
There are many "old offenders" in the profession of
investment swindling who have been convicted and have "done
time" in jails and penitentiaries, but have not yet learned to
prefer straight to crooked finance.</p>

<p>Men of this character realize that a "quick getaway" is a
cardinal essential of success; they must complete the transaction
and get in the harvest before there is time for the public
to wake up and do any investigating.</p>

<p>The length to which the bolder spirits in this class will go
almost surpasses credibility. Here is an example, discovered
by Detective Wooldridge of Chicago, of the tricks to which
they will resort in order to create the impression of having
the backing of men or institutions of strength and character:</p>

<p>Through introduction by social friends, the local representative
of an investment scheme was able to open a checking account
with a banking and trust company in a big city&mdash;a company
of such high standing that it is very widely known outside
of financial circles and among people of small means. Its
endorsement was worth "ready money" to any enterprise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
the fact was keenly appreciated by the "fiscal agents" of the
Brite &amp; Fair Bonanza Company.</p>

<p>After the opening of his personal checking account the fiscal
agent lost no time in cultivating the acquaintance of the trust
officer of the banking institution, which did a very large business
in the discharge of trusts. One day the depositor came to
this officer and explained that he had a very simple little trust
which he wished to have executed. Finding it necessary to
leave the city for a few days, he wished to provide for the delivery
of a sealed package, containing "valuable papers," to a
man whose name and personal description was given. The
person to call for the package would leave a certified check,
in the amount of $1,000, which was to be placed to the credit
of the "fiscal agent" of the Brite &amp; Fair Bonanza Company,
whose business connections were unknown to the trust officer
of the banking and trust company.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">All "Brite &amp; Fair."</span></h3>

<p>Weeks later the trust officer was astonished to receive from
an old personal friend, who was knocking about in the west, a
circular of the Brite &amp; Fair Bonanza Company, in which the
big trust company was designated as "trustee" for the "B. &amp; F."
stocks. As the friend who forwarded the circular knew something
of the wildcat nature of the Brite &amp; Fair enterprise, his
comments on the folly of the bank's accepting such a "trust"
had an edge on them.</p>

<p>When the matter was investigated it was found that the
whole plot had been carefully concocted and worked up; that
the circulars had been printed and put in directed envelopes
ready for mailing in advance of the placing of the so-called
"trust," and that when the trust officer of the solid financial
institution had given his receipt for the "sealed package said
to contain valuable papers," a telegram had been sent by the
"fiscal agent" to "mail out trustee circulars." The man in
this scheme, of course, believed that, as the circulars were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
being mailed out into a territory about a thousand miles from
the city in which the banking and trust company was located,
the trust officer who had been imposed upon would never hear
of the misuse of his receipt for a "dummy" package which
actually contained certificates of the mining company's stock.</p>

<p>Why did the men who worked this scheme to steal the moral
support of the big trust company go to so great pains to get it?
Because fake investment operators have found it profitable to
take every precaution to give the color of legality to their acts,
they have found it profitable to hire shrewd legal pilots to tell
them just how far they may go in a given direction without
running upon the reefs of the United States postoffice's "fraud
order" or upon the rocks of a "conspiracy" prosecution.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dodge Uncle Sam and Conspiracy Laws.</span></h3>

<p>Take it in the incident above related: Had these men
been prosecuted for falsely using the name of the trust company
or for obtaining money by misrepresentation (the claim
that the trust company was acting as trustee for the Brite &amp;
Fair securities), an able lawyer could have made out of the
"trust" to transfer a package of unknown contents a very
plausible defense. Again, the mining company was able to
make valuable use of the trust company's receipt for the package
by having fac similes of the receipt printed and distributed
among solicitors for the stock who were canvassing persons not
at all familiar with legal documents&mdash;and who, under the statements
and arguments of the agent, would see in the receipt an
acknowledgment that this great trust company and its millions
were behind the securities of the Brite &amp; Fair Company.</p>

<p>This brings us straight to the practical point in the matter.
Never go into an investment until you first find out for yourself,
by direct and first-hand investigation, what the "references"
named in the literature or advertising matter of the
company have to say about it, and how much the references
themselves amount to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wildcats Give Good Reference.</span></h3>

<p>Promoters of wildcat investment enterprises have used hundreds
of names as references which they had not the shadow
of right to use&mdash;calculating that persons credulous enough to
be interested in the proposition would also be credulous enough
to say, "These references will speak well enough for the enterprise,
else their names would not be given out for this purpose,"
and to act without making any inquiries of them.</p>

<p>Again, some man of prominence and great faith may have
been, at the start, a believer in the enterprise and willing to
say, within certain limitations, that he believed the venture
could be made a success if conducted according to certain plans
and under given restrictions. This does not signify that he
will continue to retain that confidence or that he is willing to
be understood as giving the venture his unqualified endorsement,
or to say to the public which respects his name and position:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Come and share this enterprise with me; put your money
into it, for it's a good thing."</p>
</div>

<p>Detective Wooldridge, who has examined many of these concerns,
desires to place special emphasis upon the crafty use
which these companies make of the names and services of
reputable "trust" companies. He uses the word "services"
because a trust company may execute a "trust" in connection
with bonds, stocks, property or securities without really assuming
any general financial or moral responsibility for those securities
or without becoming a sponsor for them. In a word,
the trust company may engage to act as an escrow agent to see
that a certain technical transaction is completed, and nothing
more. That means this: The trust company consents to hold
the stakes between two parties, but without the slightest responsibility
as to the value of those stakes or what may be done
with them after the stipulations as to the conditions precedent
to delivery have been fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

<p>Because a trust company acts as the trustee of a certain bond
issued there is no warrant for a prospective investor to feel
that the resources of the trust company are in any sense behind
these deeds as a guarantee of values.</p>

<p>Another word of caution: Whenever you see the name of an
educator, a pastor or a popular politician, or any other leader
having a hold on the sentiment of a community used in connection
with an investment offering, look into it carefully and
take no step until the person mentioned has been questioned
directly by you.</p>

game. W. H. Todd jumped his bond and fled to St. Louis,
Mo., where he was apprehended and brought back by Detective
Wooldridge.</p>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">$300,000,000 Capital.</span></h3>

<p>The book of the Central State Underwriting and Guarantee
corporation had promoted 300 corporations and companies
which were capitalized at $300,000,000. Stock bonds were
issued which was guaranteed by this company. This company
further agreed to sell these bonds and stocks to raise the money
to financier these companies.</p>

<p>The complaint was made by the Compensating Pipe Organ
Company, through C. V. Wisner. The firm is located at Battle
Creek, Mich.</p>

<p>W. H. Todd &amp; Co. was employed by the Pipe Organ Company
to make a bond issue of $150,000. The brokerage firm,
he said, demanded a 1 per cent deposit, amounting to $1,500.</p>

<p>This was paid, according to Wisner's complaint, and Todd
&amp; Company undertook to deposit the money with another
underwriting company.</p>

<p>Then, he asserts, the bond issue was never made, and Todd
&amp; Company failed to repay the $1,500.</p>

<p>The firm conducts a banking, brokerage and underwriting
business at room 803, 112 Dearborn street.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Did Heavy Business.</span></h3>

<p>Rare oriental rugs, the most costly tables and chairs, and
elaborate grandfather clocks, together with an amazing amount
of polished brass work and plate glass, were found in each of
the imposing offices raided by the deputy marshals.</p>

<p>The Central States Underwriting &amp; Guarantee Company did
a business commensurate with the costly environment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
books of the concern show that from February 1, 1903, to
August 5, 1906, 643 corporations throughout the United States
paid money to the Central States concern, and the aggregate
amount paid was $340,000.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<p>Advertisements were placed in all the leading papers throughout
the country, circulars were distributed broadcast with propositions
that capital could be obtained for corporations and
manufacturing enterprises by addressing this company.</p>

<p>The officers of corporations replying to these advertisements
would be asked to call at the Chicago offices of the companies.</p>

<p>The brokers acquainted with the scheme would then introduce
the corporation officials to alleged capitalists who represented
they had available capital to finance business propositions,
and would buy the underwritten stock, provided the corporation
officers would have them underwritten by responsible
guarantee companies.</p>

<p>It is asserted that these alleged capitalists would then advise
that the work be done by the Central States Underwriting
&amp; Guarantee Company, the American Corporation &amp; Securities
Company, or the National Stock &amp; Guarantee Company of
San Francisco.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scheme of the Company.</span></h3>

<p>The brokers in the alleged fraudulent transactions would
represent to the proposed victim that they would get no returns
for their work unless they actually sold the stocks, and
that they would be content with a commission of from one-half to
1 per cent on such stock as they sold. They assured the victims
that there could be no doubt that the stock underwritten would
be sold, as the capitalists to whom the victims had been introduced
would be certain to buy them.</p>

<p>The brokers would then take the men seeking the underwriting
to the offices of the guarantee companies and arrange
for guaranteeing the bonds on payment of a fee of 1 per cent
of the amount of underwriting.</p>

<p>The men arrested never entered into a proposition on which
less than $100,000 was involved, and that they, in some cases,
obtained $5,000,000 worth of stock to underwrite.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge secured proof that the application fee
which was paid by the officers of the corporations to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span> underwriting
companies was always divided among those companies
and the fraudulent brokers who had sent the corporation's
officers to the supposed underwriters.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Guarantee Co. Methods.</span></h3>

<p>The Guarantee Company system is a new phase of "promotion"
that has come to the surface during the past two years,
but which, through police and legal investigation, has about
reached its limit.</p>

<p>A strictly legitimate guarantee company is modeled much
after the Fidelity and Insurance Bond corporations. They issue
secured bonds for all necessary business purposes, and are reputable
and responsible. About 1903 a promotion gang in Chicago
stole the name "Guarantee," and half a dozen fake guarantee
companies were started.</p>

<p>In all the phraseology of tricky finance there is no word so
overworked as "guarantee." And this means that experience
has proved it to be highly effective in the hooking of "suckers."
Depend upon it, that no word or phrase achieves marked popularity
in the literature of the "small investments" appeal which
has not demonstrated its rare effectiveness as an agency of deception;
the phrase that does not draw the money is promptly
thrown out by these shrewd fishers of men, who check up their
returns as accurately and systematically as the most legitimate
mail order business.</p>

<p>If the small investors of this country could reach anything
like a fair knowledge of just how much and how little there
is in each of these appealing "catch words" in each phrase,
the plausibility of which has been scientifically tested, they
would be well on the way toward being able to protect themselves
against the cleverest and most convincing of these appeals.
Perhaps the writer can do the public more service in
analyzing a few of these "star phrases" than by any amount
of denunciation of the wildcat schemes and schemers which
deserve as harsh a characterization as any man can frame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">RURAL RESIDENTS CANNOT BE TOO PROMPT IN TYING DOWN
THEIR PROPERTY.</div>
</div>

<p>But, to return to the word "guarantee," which has attained
first rank in the terminology of the investment trickster, there is
scarcely a circular, folder or advertisement, or any other piece
of literature put out by the pot hunters of small savings which
does not display the word "guarantee" in big type, and with
reiterated emphasis. If this institution chances to be of a
financial character itself, rather than a mining, oil or industrial
concern, the word "guarantee," or its twin, "security,"
will be found incorporated in the name chosen for the company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span></p>

<p>Get a list of 100 wildcat investment schemes which are dead
beyond hope of resurrection, and it is a safe prediction that
one-half the names will contain the word "guarantee" or "security."
These two words are as common to the eye in the
graveyard of fake investment schemes as is that of Smith, Jones
or Brown in any country cemetery; they adorn practically every
other tombstone in the last resting place of defunct financial
frauds.</p>

<p>The question of the value of either of these words in the title
of a corporation or concern is disposed of by the statement
that there is no legal restriction in the choice of names of
companies; the organizers are as free to name their flimsy
creation "The Rock of Gibraltar Guarantee Security Company"
as the parent is to saddle a weak, under-sized male child with
the name of Samson. And, as a rule, there is as much license
or propriety in giving the name of the mighty enemy of the
Philistines to a stunted boy as there is for applying the name
"guarantee" or "security" to a company which is brought into
being for the purpose of going out after the savings of the
"small investor."</p>

<p>Why? Because the companies which are really warranted in
making either of these words a part of their corporate name
do not have to go into the highways and hedges and beat the
bushes for their business; it comes to them by force of their
"financial strength." They have no need to drum it up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Good Advice on "Guarantee."</span></h3>

<p>However, scores of oil, mining and investment companies
which do not use either of these clever catchwords in their corporate
titles cannot be charged with undervaluing the "pulling
power" of such phrases; in their literature this kind of bait
is employed with the greatest skill and plausibility.</p>

<p>One of the most common ways in which this idea is dressed
is this: "We guarantee you, under all conditions and at all
times, to get you, without cost to yourself, the highest market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
price for your holdings." This sounds very assuring; it carries
with it a protective and almost paternal atmosphere and seldom
fails to inspire in the trusting investor the feeling that
there is a strong hand always ready to take the investment
off his shoulders the moment it threatens to become a burden.</p>

<p>This particular phrase is especially fortunate and typical,
by way of illustration, for the reason that it couples with the
word "guarantee" another term which is a warm favorite with
the word artists of the get-rich-quick studies. I allude to the
phrase, "highest market value."</p>

<p>Wherever either of these clever signals to credulity is displayed
the possible investor should invariably remember these
points:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><strong>First&mdash;A guarantee is never stronger than the guarantor.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Second&mdash;A security only has a "market value" in the
fair and true sense of the term where a large demand for
it meets a large supply; there, and there only, exists an
active market and a genuine "market value."</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Let these two propositions (which any reputable banker or
broker will tell you are axiomatic) be considered separately.
There is no virtue in the word "guarantee." If this simple fact
could have been firmly fixed in the minds of the small investors
of this country they would have been saved the loss of millions
of dollars since our present period of wonderful prosperity
began. In these days of highly perfected business organization
the process of finding out the responsibility of any financial or
business concern has been reduced to an exact science and made
available to all. Is it reasonable to suppose, under these conditions,
that any company or corporation which cannot stand
on its own feet can get any responsible concern to guarantee its
bonds or other so-called securities? Never! Such a supposition
is absurd on the face of it, and an instance where it has
been done is not, so far as is known, to be found in actual
practice.</p>

<p>Dig down under the "guarantee" of the company which asks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
you to invest your savings and what do you find? That if you
do invest you and your fellow victims are really your own
guarantors; that the financial strength of the concern is really
the money which you and your associates pour into it; that its
only financial life blood comes from the purses of the small
investors, and that when the stream of vitality from this source
begins to dry up, the services of the financial undertaker are in
near and inevitable demand.</p>

<p>Reduced to its last analysis, the blacktype declaration of a
"guarantee" in the literature of the "get-rich-quick" concern
simply means that it has something to sell you. Generally, it
is also an invitation to you to pay in advance for the flowers to
adorn your own financial funeral.</p>

<p>As to the other pet phrase, "highest market value," or market
value of any kind, for that matter, a very few words will
suggest the situation:</p>

<p>Excepting where a very large demand meets an insufficient
supply in a free, open and comparatively unmanipulated market,
where sales are regularly made of record and those records
command the respect and confidence of the legitimate financial
public, there is no "market value" save that which is arbitrarily
made by the broker. He is the market; he makes the
price by the simple process of "thumbs up" or "thumbs down."</p>

<p>The man who is on the "sucker" list of a wildcat concern
receives an announcement that "all indications point to the
conclusion that next week the stock of the Honor Bright Company
will sell at not less than five points advance of the present
price."</p>

<p>The next week he gets notice that the prediction of an advance
had proved true. If he is unsophisticated enough he receives
the announcement with solemn credulity and credits the
author of the promotion literature with great acumen and
shrewd prophetic powers. He figures up the profits he would
have made on the advance and condemns himself for not heeding
the "confidential" advice to "buy quick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>

<p>What he does not consider is the fact that he is dealing with
a fictitious market, where the seller simply makes up his mind
how much he will advance the stock in question and then,
when the time comes, marks it up and makes the announcement
of the "sharp advance." This trick is turned not only for the
purpose of getting a larger price per share, but mainly to
tickle the cupidity of hesitating investors and making sales
which otherwise could not have been made.</p>

<p>In order to understand how these companies operate, the
actual experience of one victim will serve to explain the whole
system.</p>

<p>A country manufacturer, rated at $50,000, read an advertisement
in a financial journal about as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Capital Supplied&mdash;We have the means of furnishing any
amount of capital for any meritorious industrial proposition.
Address Lock Box XX, Chicago."</p>
</div>

<p>The manufacturer wrote he wanted to raise $100,000 to increase
his business, and offered to put in all his effects, stock
and good will. He received a letter asking him to come to
Chicago and visit the firm, which, for convenience, shall be described
as "Cold Cash &amp; Co." He did so. Cash received him
in an elegant office with open arms. The manufacturer there
re-stated his necessities. The affable broker informed him his
proposition was a fine one, and said he could have the desired
$100,000 within thirty days.</p>

<p>"What would be the broker's fee?" he inquired. Only 5 per
cent when $100,000 was in the hands of the manufacturer.
Certainly an alluring prospect. But how was the money to be
raised? The manufacturer was to incorporate his business for
$200,000, and the broker would sell half of its capital stock
at par.</p>

<p>As the delighted "sucker" was about to leave the broker's
office the latter, in the most off-hand manner, said: "Oh, by
the way, Mr. Manufacturer, what arrangements have you made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
to guarantee your capital stock?" "Guarantee it? I don't
understand you," replied the victim.</p>

<p>"Bless you!" said the broker, "modern methods demand that
all stock be guaranteed&mdash;quite the new order of things. We
couldn't sell a share of stock nowadays unless it was guaranteed."</p>

<p>"Explain!"</p>

<p>"I will. You go to some guarantee company and have them
agree to guarantee the payment of the principal of each share
of stock sold at thirty years. Don't you see that makes your
stock as solid as a government bond?</p>

<p>"The guarantee company takes a certain portion of the proceeds
of the stock, invests it for thirty years. With interest
and compound interest, in 1935 the stock has accumulated its
par sum. It is a beautiful system."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Do Booming Business.</span></h3>

<p>"Very plausible, but where are these guarantee companies?"</p>

<p>"Why, there are The National, The States, and The Industrial.
We hear The States is doing a booming business. Go
and see them. They are at such a number."</p>

<p>The victim went to the richly furnished suite of offices occupied
by the guarantee company and met its dignified "president,"
to whom he explained the purpose of his visit.</p>

<p>"Very good," said that official. "We will accept your risk.
We will issue you an option agreeing within one year to issue
you bonds against your stock as sold, you to pay us an advance
fee of $1,000."</p>

<p>The "sucker" demurred. He had only $500 spare cash. The
president suggested that as the broker would make a liberal
commission out of the deal he might put up the other $500.
The manufacturer 'phoned the broker, who promptly agreed to
pay one-half of the fee. The broker gave the victim a worthless
check for $500, which he gave, together with $500 of his
own good money, into the hands of the "guarantee" company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
The company thereupon issued a certificate, or option, for bonds
that were never called for because the broker never sold any
of the stock.</p>

<p>The victim went home loaded down with promises. The
broker "strung" him along for a month or two, but sold no
stock. Finally the manufacturer realized he was buncoed. The
broker and the "guarantee" company divided the $500, and
proceeded to find other suckers.</p>

<p>March 17, 1906, E. C. Talmage, who conducted the National
Underwriting &amp; Bond Co., of San Francisco, Cal.; the
Pacific Underwriting &amp; Trust Co., of San Francisco, Cal.; the
Imperial Bond &amp; Trust Co., of New Jersey City, New Jersey;
the International Trust Co., of Philadelphia; the Chicago National
Bonding Co., of Chicago, at 52 Dearborn street; E. C.
Talmage; E. S. Barnum, 103 Randolph street; and M. J.
Carpenter, of the First National bank, were arrested.</p>

<p>George D. Talmage, another member of the firm located at
Kansas City, Mo., was afterwards arrested and brought to
Chicago, charged with obtaining money under the confidence
game. The warrants on which they were arrested were taken
out by E. J. Denison and Rev. Peter A. Baart, a Methodist
minister of Marshall, Mich., who were officers of the La Vaca
mines and mills, of Joplin, Mo.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Baart first went to E. C. Talmage.</p>

<p>Talmage sent him to E. S. Barnum to have the stock guaranteed.
Barnum charged him a fee of $500 and agreed to sell
the bonds, which he failed to do. They just simply divided
this fee between them and made no effort to float the bonds.</p>

<p>Among the persons alleged to have suffered losses are the

<p>E. C. Talmage, S. D. Talmage and E. S. Barnum were indicted
by the Cook county grand jury.</p>

<p>George D. Talmage fled to Kansas City, Mo., where he conducted
a branch office in the same business. He was arrested
at Kansas City, Mo., on request of the chief of police of Chicago,
for operating the confidence game. Extradition papers
were secured and Detective Wooldridge brought him back.
When his father's office was raided, at 52 Dearborn street, a
number of letters was seized, among them were several written
from George D. Talmage, at Kansas City, Mo.</p>

<p>The following extracts are taken from George D. Talmage's
letter to his father:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Saw old Blank today. He was easy. Inclosed find his
check for $1,000"; and, "When I mentioned bonds to old Tightwad
he fell over backwards and swallowed a set of false teeth."</p>

<p>One from a town in Kansas is said to have read: "Nothing
doing in this joint. The people here wouldn't buy gold dollars
for 90 cents."</p>
</div>

<p>One letter which reflected particularly upon the cupidity of
our K. C., U. S. A. citizens, runs: "I am giving it to these
little Kansas City suckers strong. I expect to be able to send
you $1,000 the last of the week."</p>

<p>E. C. Talmage, George D. Talmage and E. S. Barnum were
placed on trial before Judge Brentano for swindling the Rev.
Peter A. Baart, Marshall, Mo., out of $500.</p>

<p>E. S. Barnum was discharged and the Talmages found
guilty.</p>

<p>A new trial was secured for George D. Talmage. His father,
E. C. Talmage, on May 10, 1907, was sentenced to an indefinite
term in the Joliet penitentiary.</p>

<h2><a id="THE_SOCIAL_EVIL">THE SOCIAL EVIL.</a></h2>


<p>The treatment of the social evil is one of the most difficult
problems with which society has ever been confronted. Until
society is thoroughly regenerated and the consequent purity,
both of manhood and womanhood, has become a permanent
fact, illicit relationship between man and woman will exist.</p>

<p>The attraction of the sexes is as mighty as it is mysterious.
No legislation will weaken its inherent force.</p>

<p>The man who can come forward with a cure for this great
curse is, I fear, yet to be born.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 533px;">
<img src="images/img129.jpg" width="533" height="525" alt="(People running by heart)" />
</div>

<p>In common with other vices the so-called "social evil" is as
old as mankind, and it will probably remain as long as vice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
sin are found in the human heart. Its complete eradication
will, perhaps, never be accomplished solely through the process
of law, yet it seems to me that the law and its administrators
should not lessen their efforts to destroy this evil.</p>

<p>In Norway, and in Switzerland, are the conditions most
favorable to virtue and independence, the absence of extreme
wealth and poverty. Both countries are comparatively isolated
from the rest of the world. In Switzerland, as well as Norway,
there is an absence of large masses pent up together in
cities, the population being distributed in small numbers about
the country. Sir John Bowring, sent from England to investigate
Swiss society, found that "a drunkard is seldom seen, and
illegitimate children are rare." As a people these Swiss are a
testimonial to the doctrine of equal distribution of wealth and
temperate habits as preventive of immorality.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">America Follows Old Lines.</span></h3>

<p>The history of the United States is the history of all countries
as regards prostitution. The population is made up of all
nations, civilized and semi-civilized. In the majority of cases
poverty is the greatest incentive to prostitution. Permanent
prostitution has a numerical relation to the means of occupation.</p>

<p>At the present time in all parts of the United States the
lower strata of men and women are deprived of the results of
their labor except in quantities barely sufficient to retain life
in their bodies. They are huddled together indiscriminately
as to sex, in close, crowded quarters, so that the ordinary delicacies
of life cannot be practiced even if there should be a desire.</p>

<p>The chiefest and often the only form of pleasure within
their reach is that given by nature for the purest and best use
in life, but which comes to be the veriest debauchery. Children
and youth growing up among adults, depraved because no ray
of light was shed to show the way for moral and physical uplifting,
must naturally imbibe the miasma of social impurity.
From the very cradle through life their influence is to further
degrade themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand are the extreme rich, who, not being compelled
to labor for sustenance, spend their time and money in
selfish enjoyment. In contrast with the extreme poor, they
have every possibility to cultivate the good in themselves, but
will not, and it grows pale and sickly among the rank weeds
of their selfishness.</p>

<p>Chiefly, among self-gratifications, are social evil habits, especially
on part of the men of wealth. Their manner of life,
the food they eat, creates a fictitious force which must expend
itself. They may have a chivalrous regard for the women of
their class, but consider all women below them to be legitimate
prey.</p>

<p>Relying on their wealth to insinuate themselves into the
good graces of young women by supplying them with such
things as will gratify vanity, the offspring of rich parentage
find fascination in pursuit of their object. When she is at last
won, and her virtuous scruples overcome, she is thrown aside
like the wilted flower which has yielded all its perfume. The
brothel is open to receive all such, particularly if she be handsome
of face or form.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Only Burned Orphan Asylum.</span></h3>

<p>New York, Chicago, St. Louis, any great city will furnish
examples by the thousands. Where one girl enters this life
from choice (through sensuality inherited from the lust of her
father, no doubt), ninety-nine are sucked into its whirlpool by
force of circumstances. The young woman who is a clerk is
paid an amount which will barely cover the cost of living. She
is expected to dress well, and if she protests that she can not,
is told to rely on some "gentleman friend" for other expenses.
Likewise in factories and shops. Only she who is protected
by home associations, and whose labor is done to add to the
general home comfort, can hope to escape, and then not always.</p>

<p>The grim, irrefutable facts in connection with the thrusting
of the working girl into prostitution by the wealthy owners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
department stores, was never better expressed than in a recent
story by O. Henry, in McClure's Magazine.</p>

<p>Henry dreamed that he had been dead a long while, and
that he had finally arrived at the Judgment Day. An Angel
policeman was haling him before the Great Court of Last Resort.
As he was forced into the waiting room the Angel policeman
asked him kindly if he belonged with a certain crowd which he
saw near him. The members of this coterie were dressed in
frock coats, gray trousers, spats, patent leather shoes, and all
of them boasted of high silk hats.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked the trembling Henry. "Oh, they
are the men who ran big department stores and paid their poor
girls five dollars a week in order that they themselves might
belong to clubs, go to Europe and own fine residences and automobiles,"
replied the angel.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," replied Henry. "I'm only the feller
that murdered a blind man for his pennies and burned down
the orphan asylum. I don't belong with that bunch."</p>

<p>With the present system of government, each year tends to
annihilate the middle class, in which lies a nation's strength.</p>

</div>

<p>While extreme poverty exists on the one hand, and extreme
wealth on the other, it would be as plausible to dam up Niagara
Falls as to stop prostitution by legislating against it. The current,
checked in one course, is bound to break out in another,
and with all its pent-up force. Human life, like the river, is
bound to flow in the channel of the least resistance.</p>

<p>Nature planned the association of the sexes as surely and as
inevitably as any other of her laws. Whenever her laws are
trespassed upon in any way there is suffering. The wretched
conditions of the poor and the perverted natures of the wealthy
turn sex association into social evil.</p>

talents and their better selves, honorable marriage would be
preferred to prostitution in nearly every case.</p>

<p>There is no hope for moral purification among the wealthy
until such time as they will use their time and talents in useful
work. An enormous field for missionary work would be
for some one of ability to convert the wealthy world to the
religion of useful work. As a self-evident truth, no able-bodied
person has the right to live off the labor of another person. Instead
of the many working to the last notch of human endurance
that the few may live in luxury and idleness, there should
be labor for all, and enough for all. Money, however, is without
love, or patriotism, or kindness&mdash;is all-powerful, and is
fawned upon, and catered to by those possessing it in limited
quantities.</p>

<p>The remedy for prostitution, as well as other evils, lies in the
hands of the American people themselves, if they only knew it.
Just a few years of intelligent voting and legislating for better
conditions for the many, instead of for the few extremely
wealthy, would tend to overcome all injustice and inequality.
The social evil would be weeded out because people would then
have time to obey the injunction, "Know Thyself."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Average Evil Life Very Short.</span></h3>

<p>According to statistics the average life of a prostitute is four
years after entering the maelstrom of such a career. The life
is never such as to be recommended even by its followers. It
is moral as well as physical death when followed, and is well-nigh
impossible to escape once having bowed to its seeming
fascination.</p>

<p>As to the libertine, he "sells himself for what he buys." He
may enjoy pleasure, but not happiness. Happiness comes from
within, in the consciousness of doing right. Pleasures come
from without, in the gratification of self. In addition to the
hollowness of the enjoyment in the lives of prostitute and libertine,
is always the danger of loathsome disease which tortures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
body and brain, lowering them in their own minds. It is
about the only ill in the category that does not command sympathy,
but it should.</p>

<p>The evils of drunkenness, theft, or prostitution are on the
same basis as far as the "necessity" for their existence. All are
more or less the result of a badly adjusted economic condition
of whatever nation. They can be reduced to a minimum, if
not eradicated, by removing the cause.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Argument Against Segregation.</span></h3>

<p>The first and most convincing argument against the segregation
of vice is found in the fact that the law expressly condemns
crime of all kinds and requires its relentless prosecution
in order to effect its destruction. Besides, vice districts would
shortly become breeding spots for the propagation of crime
of every kind. Here would be attracted the criminal classes
from all parts of the country, because here they would be protected
by the very law which they violate.</p>

<p>Not only would the inhabitants of such districts regard themselves
within the law, but others, who now fear to enter these
resorts because of the probability of arrest and public exposure,
would patronize the district, armed with the knowledge that
non-arrest was a certainty and exposure highly improbable.
The locality and extent of such districts would soon become a
matter of common information, and young men would thus
find easy access to disreputable resorts which otherwise they
might never find.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Evil Not Necessary.</span></h3>

<p>Many advance the argument that the evil is a necessary one
and must be tolerated, else the safety of virtuous women upon
our streets would be seriously threatened and imperiled. The
fallacy and absurdity of this contention is proved by the conditions
which exist in many of the large cities of Great Britain
and Canada, where houses of ill-fame are practically unknown,
and where women are as safe as in cities where the segregation
of vice prevails. This result has been obtained by persistent
effort on the part of officials whose duty it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span> suppress
and punish crime. Such a condition can never be secured
here if districts are established where this particular
form of vice may flourish with the tacit approval of our public
officers. Surely we in Chicago are not willing to admit that
which has been done elsewhere cannot be done here.</p>

<p>Chicago could not legally license or regulate this evil, for
our state law forbids license. The moral sentiment of our
people is also against it. Several years or so ago, when a resolution
was introduced into the city council looking toward segregation,
medical examination and license, a vigorous protest was
made by the Chicago Woman's Club, the Evanston Woman's
Club, and other such organizations. The good women of Chicago
will not tamely submit to such additional degradation of
their wronged sisters.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nobler Womanhood the Goal.</span></h3>

<p>Chicago women are working hard to protect innocent women
from lives of infamy and to help the repentant to a nobler
womanhood. If there were men working among their own sex
with equal devotions there would be a lessening of the social
evil. If physicians would teach men the safety of chastity and
the horrors of licentiousness, if preachers would train their guns
against impurity, if popular clubs would expel licentious men,
if the mayor would order the arrest of every person, man or
woman, found in these houses, apparently so well known to
the police, and have such arrests continued night after night,
these methods would cause a marked lessening of the social evil.</p>

<p>The police of Chicago have done much in recent years to
make it a better city. To them is due the credit more than to
anyone else for better conditions in our moral life. If they are
encouraged and allowed to work out these problems in their
own practical way they will do more for our city's good than
all the theoretical reformers combined.</p>

<p>Many conditions ought not to exist, but they must and will
remain for the present. Your reformer, so-called, writes and
pleads for the ideal. The police force deals with what is and
knows best what can be done.</p>

<p>The "lid" should be put upon deadly weapons&mdash;pistols, revolvers,
dirk knives, brass knuckles&mdash;not merely to hide them,
but to prevent their manufacture and sale.</p>

<p>While serving as police officer I could not fail to observe
that substantially all of the crimes committed with the pistol
or revolver resulted from the practice of carrying the weapon
upon the person. There would be a controversy in a bar-room,
on the street or elsewhere, followed by a fight and
ending with a shooting by someone present who had the weapon
conveniently concealed upon his person. But for the presence
of the weapon on the scene there would have been no shooting.</p>

<p>I recall but one case where the defendant left the scene of the
controversy to procure a weapon. Murder committed by lying
in wait or with premeditation for any length of time is extremely
rare. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the crime
is committed on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>Statistics furnished by the police department show startling
facts. Citizens do not realize the number of persons who are
either wounded or killed every year by shooting with the revolver.
One can hardly pick up a metropolitan paper without
finding an account of a shooting, either by accident or design.
We have laws forbidding the carrying of concealed weapons,
which are to a certain extent effective, but to a very small extent,
because it is practically impossible to search every man
on the street&mdash;and keep him searched. The law, no matter how
rigidly enforced, can do but little substantial good.</p>

<p>We must also consider other deadly weapons, such as dirk
knives and brass knuckles. So far as these are concerned, they
are manufactured solely to be used as instruments of crime.
The brass knuckle is never used as a weapon of defense, but
always as one of offense. The dirk knife has no use other than
as a weapon to be used against human beings. It is not used
either in war or for any domestic purpose.</p>

<p>So far as the revolver is concerned, it has no proper use anywhere
in the world. It is carried either as a weapon of offense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
or defense; but as a weapon of defense it is only possibly effective
when there is a revolver in the hands of the antagonist. If
he has none, none is needed for defense.</p>

<p>An attack made upon a man at close quarters by the use
of a sandbag or any other weapon in the hands cannot be met
practically with a revolver. There is no time or opportunity
for its use.</p>

<p>The proposition is therefore sound that, if no one carried a
pistol for offense, none would be needed for defense.</p>

<p>Shotguns and rifles are used in hunting, but not the revolver.
The ordinary revolver of commerce, the one which a man can
carry concealed, has no use in modern warfare. There is no
legitimate use anywhere for such a weapon.</p>

<p>September, 1907, officials of the New York police department,
acting under Commissioner Bingham's orders, took 5,000 revolvers
out to sea beyond Sandy Hook and threw them overboard.
The literary secretary of the commissioner said it reminded
him of the Doges who used to wed the sea with rings.
If the New York ceremony was not so richly symbolical it certainly
was vastly more sensible.</p>

<p>These revolvers were the results of eighteen months of police
seizures. Some of them were automatic weapons in the $28
class, and others were of the common variety used by small
boy initiates in crime. Together they were worth at least $15,000.
Not so very long ago New York City held an auction
sale every year just before the Fourth of July at which all confiscated
weapons were sold. Thereby Fourth of July killings
were made easy and cheap, and crime at all other times of the
year was encouraged, for most of the weapons went to pawnbrokers
and second-hand dealers, who put them back in the
hands that would use them worst. The police have one instance
of a revolver that to their knowledge came back into their possession
four times in this way.</p>

<p>It is wise to destroy these weapons, but consider how little
good is accomplished compared with what might be accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
by original control of the sale of weapons. The city
sacrifices the $15,000 or something less which it might have got
for these weapons, but if it would take $15,000 and spend it
vigorously in regulating the sale of weapons, in licensing and
perhaps heavily taxing all dealers, in requiring the keeping of
complete records of sales and in prosecuting all persons carrying
concealed weapons, it would accomplish very much more to the
same end.</p>

<p>Chicago is a city in which unlimited laxity is allowed dealers
in pistols. The way is made easy for the criminal who wants to
arm himself. Despite the successful experience of other cities
in regulating the sales of weapons, the council is reluctant
to give the city a stronger ordinance.</p>

<p>Suicide with the revolver is a favorite method of self-destruction
with men. Press the muzzle against the head or heart, a
slight pressure of the forefinger&mdash;instant oblivion follows.</p>

<p>The bandit who holds up the railroad train and robs the
passengers almost invariably uses a revolver. With this small
weapon he terrorizes and robs an entire trainload of travelers.</p>

<p>The vicious carry pistols with criminal intent, but there is
also a very large class, which might be designated as a "weak"
class, which carries the pistol without any criminal intent, but
under the influence of a fascination for the handling of deadly
weapons. Among certain classes of negroes it is the habit to
carry pistols or other deadly weapons to balls, parties or other
places where they congregate, and they carry them, apparently,
to a certain extent, as a matter of ornament, something on the
principle of our gentlemanly forefathers of a few hundred years
ago, who considered no full-dress equipment complete without
the rapier. The very fact that these weapons are present leads
to brawls and quarrels, which result only too frequently in killing,
or an attempt to kill.</p>

<p>It is dangerous to put into the hands of a weak person a
weapon which may carry death and destruction by the small
pressure of the finger. The very handling of such weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
seems to breed the desire to use them. The situation is something
similar to that of a man who gazes over the brink of a
precipice and to whom there comes an almost irresistible desire
to throw himself over.</p>

<p>There would be some force in the argument that the law-abiding
citizen has the right to carry a revolver to protect himself
from thugs if his pistol were any real protection; but it is
not. The attack from the thug on the highway comes so suddenly
and unexpectedly that there is rarely an opportunity to use
a weapon in defense; and, even if it should occasionally happen
that a man would be at a disadvantage because he had no pistol,
this loss to the community is outweighed a thousand to one by
the evils which follow its use.</p>

<p>Why should we permit men to manufacture and sell instruments
of crime&mdash;weapons which are designed for no other purpose?
We do have laws which prevent the free sale of poisons,
based upon the fact that poisons may be used as a means of self-destruction
or in the destruction of others. But we have no
safeguards against the purchase and use of these other deadly
agencies.</p>

<p>A brilliant display of deadly weapons may be found in any
first-class hardware store, one which is peculiarly tempting to
the young, the weak and the vicious. Pawnshops are heavily
stocked with weapons of this character.</p>

<p>There are a hundred places on the streets of Chicago, particularly
on Clark and State streets, where may be found in
cases standing in front of stores a display of brass knuckles,
dirks and revolvers, which can be purchased at a very small
price&mdash;and without restrictions of any kind. Yet they are
purchased, almost exclusively, to be used as instruments of
crime.</p>

<p>Experience has demonstrated that the laws which forbid the
carrying of concealed weapons are not effective; and it is not
possible that, in the very nature of things, they can be entirely
so. There is only one sure and effective way of preventing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
criminal use of these deadly weapons&mdash;that is, to make it impossible
for men to get hold of them. This can be done only
by forbidding their manufacture and sale. The State, in the
exercise of its police power, has authority to pass laws of this
character.</p>

<p>I submit that it is the duty of the community to demand
the passage of such laws. There seems to be no answer to this
proposition when you consider that these articles are not manufactured
to sell for any legitimate purpose, and that to deprive
men of the privilege of manufacturing and selling deadly weapons
does not, in any degree, deprive the community of anything
which may be of any real use or benefit.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the State to prevent as well as to punish
crime and to protect its weak and vicious citizens, so far as it
can, from the temptation to do wrong. We would not tempt
men to steal by affording them easy opportunities for theft,
especially if we knew that they were either weak or wicked.
And yet, we make absolutely no effort to keep deadly weapons
out of dangerous hands. We do attempt to forbid their concealment.
Practically this attempt is a failure and, in effect,
we permit men to carry deadly weapons which may be successfully
concealed until the very moment they are brought into use.</p>

<p>A great deal of the lurid literature has grown up around the
pistol. The cowboy with his gun play has always been an
attractive character in fiction. No doubt there is a time in the
pioneer life of a community when there seems to be some excuse
for the use of the revolver. But a dispassionate view of this
subject, having in mind the welfare of a settled, organized State,
every part of which is pervaded by law and within its restraining
influence, points to the conclusion that the time has come to
legislate revolvers, dirks and brass knuckles out of existence.</p>


<h3>QUEERS THE TOWN.</h3>

<p>The elaborate display of revolvers, dirks and brass knuckles
in shop windows creates a most unfavorable impression on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span> visitors.
Many travelers like to walk to their hotels for the exercise
after the long journey from the east.</p>

<p>They get their first impression of Chicago from a walk up
Clark or State street.</p>

<p>On all sides they see revolvers, bludgeons, sandbags and slung-shots.
"Ah! This is the West at last," say many. "Now look
out for Indians and grizzy bears."</p>

<p>Upon Chicagoans who witness these exhibitions of criminal
tools daily the effect is most depressing. It makes them think
that civilization is still far off. In New York there is an ordinance
forbidding pawnshops to display such weapons in the window.</p>

<p>The accidental shootings, alone, caused by the careless handling
of pistols, would justify a law preventing their manufacture
and sale. What possible benefit can be suggested to offset
the evils which we have spoken of? Certainly the idea of individual
liberty cannot be carried to the extent of making it the
duty of a State to afford a man the facilities for the commission
of crime. There is no right involved in the matter which is
worthy of respect. Let me give you a few illustrations:</p>

<p>A negro carried his revolver with him to a ball. This was
customary. During a lull in the dance, while talking with his
companions&mdash;men and women&mdash;he pulls out this revolver and
shows it around for the admiration of his friends. He is under
the impression that it is not loaded. He places it playfully at
the head of his sweetheart, pulls the trigger, and she drops dead.</p>

<p>That chamber happened to be loaded. It was determined to
be a case of wanton carelessness on his part and he was sentenced
to two years in the penitentiary. Why should a man like that
be allowed to carry a pistol at all? Under what possible circumstances
could he use it in any legitimate way?</p>

<p>A few months ago the cashier in a bank, a valuable citizen,
in a neighboring town, sat down at his desk in a despondent
moment. He opened the drawer, saw the revolver lying there,
and, overcome by an irresistible impulse, he placed the muzzle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
to his head, pulled the trigger and&mdash;he is a dead man! There
is not one chance in a thousand that this man would either
have taken poison, with its lingering agonies, cut his throat,
hung himself or jumped off the bridge.</p>

<p>The other day, in the country near by, a man with his hands
in his pockets stepped up to a wagon standing in front of his
door and said to the driver: "You made an insulting remark
about me to my wife a few weeks ago. Will you apologize?"
The driver replied: "I do not know that I made such a remark."
"Well," the man replied, "your time has come." He pulled out
his pistol, which he had held concealed all the time in his hand,
and fired the shot; the driver of the wagon fell over the dashboard&mdash;dead.
Here, without warning, without the slightest
ground to expect such an act, the man, who might, under any
other circumstances, have had some possible chance for defense,
was hurled into eternity, apparently, to gratify the mere desire
to kill.</p>

<p>A few nights ago a lone robber boarded a railroad train and
with a revolver compelled the conductor and porter to walk
through the car in front of him and demanded of the passengers
that they surrender their money and jewels&mdash;which the
passengers promptly proceeded to do. The entire train was held
up by a single pistol, a thing which would be absolutely impossible
with any other weapon. A revolver enables the highwayman
to use one of his hands free, which he could not if he had
either a shotgun or a rifle.</p>

<p>And so it goes. Instance after instance is within the recollection
of everyone where crime is made possible by the easy possession
of this deadly weapon&mdash;the revolver. The point I wish to
emphasize is, that there is no legitimate use for the revolver
anywhere in the world; no reason for its existence; no legitimate
use for the dirk knife or the brass knuckles.</p>

<p>All these things are manufactured and sold as instruments
of crime. And, although their deadly use is familiar to everybody,
yet we seem to take it for granted that the right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span> manufacture
and sell them and the right to own them are rights
which the law is bound to protect. We seek only to impose a
restriction that is vain and ineffective.</p>

<p>Pistol carrying is an American habit; one which is comparatively
infrequent abroad, and there is in Europe&mdash;particularly
in England&mdash;compared with us, a proportionately small fraction
of shooting affairs. Even policemen in London do not carry
revolvers.</p>

<p>It is time for us to take this evil seriously in hand and effect
a cure, which, to be effective, must be radical.</p>

<p>I favor a law restricting the display and sale of firearms.
Carrying a loaded revolver concealed ought to be made a felony.
For carrying a concealed weapon&mdash;firearm, dirk, brass knucks,
razor, knife, etc.&mdash;the penalty cannot be too severe. I would
cut out the fine and make the penalty for carrying a concealed
weapon three to twelve months in the Workhouse and
from two to five years in the penitentiary.</p>

<p>A severe penalty would help the police to break up this criminal
habit. It would help to tame the ex-convict who returns
to a life of crime. It would aid in overcoming the influence
of the cheap novel among light-minded youth. Sale of weapons
which can be concealed on the person ought to be restricted
to officers of the law. If permits are issued at all, they ought to
be given by a responsible officer of the law.</p>

<p>Concealed weapons are the cause of a large per cent of the
crimes committed in which weapons are used. There were
many arrests for carrying concealed weapons in the last official
year. Thousands of people carry them. Every man with a concealed
weapon, unless he has a right to carry it to serve the public
peace, is a danger to the citizens of Chicago. Men who carry
concealed weapons imagine they would protect themselves with
them; often they would, but more often the weapons serve no
good purpose. Make the law against promiscuous sale and carrying
of concealed weapons so severe that it will be necessary
for the officers of the law only to carry them.</p>

a Game That Fools the Uninitiated.</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>How the Rhodus Boys Worked the Old "Come-On."</b></p>


<p>One of the most open frauds, one which should not for a
minute have deceived any investor in "securities" and things,
was unearthed by Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge, and the
results of his work were shown in Chicago when Thomas Rhodus
and Birch F. Rhodus were indicted by the federal grand
jury.</p>

<p>The Central Life Securities Company in Chicago was apparently
a sound concern. The managers were always careful
to keep money in the bank and any insinuation that this
was not a sound company was immediately refuted by bankers
who were handling the Rhodus money.</p>

<p>But Detective Wooldridge had seen so much of "guaranty"
and "security" that he was suspicious of all companies which
made this name a rallying point in their literature.</p>

<p>Also the Rhodus brothers seemed to be using the same old
catch-words which had beguiled men into the fake underwriting
schemes. So the detective was not impressed by "security"
or "guarantee." He proceeded to investigate the record
of the Rhodus brothers.</p>

<p>And ere the great scandal began to open out and assert itself,
Wooldridge found that the Rhodus brothers had been
in the lottery business in Denver in 1889 and 1890. Now it
does not conduce to belief in the soundness of a firm to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
that its managers have been common, cheap lottery workers.
So Wooldridge went into the record.</p>

<p>In the course of his examinations he discovered that the
Chicago Independent in January, 1899, contained the following
notice:</p>

<p>In 1889 and 1890, Thos. Rhodus and Birch F. Rhodus were
operating the Denver Lottery Company, later called the Denver
State Lottery. The following are extracts from the Chicago
Independent, January, 1899, number: "The attention of
the postoffice authorities was attracted to this scheme by seeing
circulars of the Denver Lottery Company about August 20,
1890, saying, 'All remittances to be addressed to A. C. Ross
&amp; Co.,' who were none other than Thomas F. Rhodus, Jr.
Ross, or Rhodus, Jr., was arrested by postoffice authorities
October 5, 1889, fined $100 and costs, which was paid November,
1889. A. C. Johnson, alias A. C. Ross, alias Thomas
F. Rhodus, Jr., was arrested March, 1890, and was at that
time running what was called the Denver State Lottery Company,
having changed its name from Denver Lottery Company.
They kept arresting him daily for over forty days. The
federal grand jury found five indictments, with over one hundred
counts, against A. C. Johnson, alias Thomas Rhodus, Jr.,
for fraudulent use of the United States mails. He then
changed his business to the name of Bank of Commerce. Was
arrested several times, and then sold out, or pretended to do
so, to Birch F. Rhodus.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Trying Their Hand at Life Insurance.</span></h3>

<p>"The Western Mutual Life Association of this city has
been weighed in the balance by the Missouri and Michigan
State Insurance Commissioners and found wanting. An examination
of the concern by these officials, made as of August
31, 1898, has recently been reported upon. On that date a
deficiency of assets under the most favorable showing of
$55,635.36 was shown to exist. In other words, the association
was impaired that amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span></p>

<p>"President Thomas F. Rhodus and Vice-President Birch F.
Rhodus each received a salary of $10,000 a year, and there
seems to have been a handsome expense allowance besides. Secretary
Charles S. Johnson received $7,000 annually; Second
Vice-President John B. Kirk, of James S. Kirk &amp; Co., and
Treasurer J. V. Clarke, President of the Hibernian Bank,
under an arrangement, the annual sum of $27,000."</p>

<p>The facts here cited were disclosed by the investigation made
by the Insurance Commissioners mentioned above. The association
did not long survive this incident, and its assets were
soon taken over by the Illinois Life Insurance Company.</p>

<p>When the records of these men are considered, it is believed
that the boldness of their operations, the ease with which they
have obtained the endorsement of representative business men
in Chicago and elsewhere for their various schemes, and the
way in which, unchecked, they have personally profited from
their operations in the name of legitimate business, are absolutely
without a parallel in the history of this city.</p>

<p>Any number of stockholders in the different companies stand
ready to testify to the correctness of the foregoing. Every
company started and operated by these men appears to have
been exploited for the sole benefit of themselves. The stockholders
have, with a few insignificant exceptions, lost every
dollar invested.</p>

<p>This was the opening gun in the Rhodus campaign. When
Detective Wooldridge began boring in he found that in addition
to the Central Life Securities Company (whatever that
might mean), the Rhodus brothers were promoting the moss-grown
mining proposition, and that the Mina Grande Mining
Company, with certain holes in the ground located in the
State of Sonora, Mexico, was also a Rhodus Company.</p>

<p>The Mercantile Finance Company, which was capitalized at
the sum of $1,000 in the State of Maine, Maine being almost
as easy as New Jersey as a corporation state, was the basis
for the manipulation of all the other companies. Even Maine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
would not stand for a big capitalization of penniless adventurers,
so to make the capitalization bug the services of the
Mina Grande and the State of Sonora, where things are still
easier than in Maine, were called in and the capitalization of
the Mina Grande was rated at $2,000,000.</p>

<p>This did not look nice to the detective. There was too much
hunting of easy ground. He bored in further. Then he discovered
the true inwardness of the situation. Around Joplin,
Webb City, Carterville and other cities in Southwest Missouri,
are certain very fine lead and zinc mines. Joplin is the first
zinc producing city in the world. It has been known as such
for a number of years. The lead from this district is second
only in output to that of Leadville, Colo. Here was another
easy chance.</p>

<p>Of course any one who knew anything at all about the lay
of the land in Jasper County, Mo., knew that all the possible
lead and zinc lands had been snapped up years ago; that
"Pat" Sullivan of Joplin had been a political boss on the
strength of his turning monopolist of the very districts which
produced the lead and zinc. But the public did not know it.
At least not the great, gullible public. They only knew that
Jasper County was full of lead and zinc and they in some
way formed the conclusion that the whole county was underlaid
with the precious metals.</p>

<p>Therefore it was easy for the Rhodus "companies" to start
the "Independent Zinc Securities Company," bore a few holes
in the ground which would produce fish-worms and black ants
and nothing else, and "transfer the stock of the 'Mina Grande'
to the 'Independent Zinc'." This only was used as a safeguard
where a stockholder of Mina Grande began to get peevish
because the holes in the hillsides of Sonora produced nothing.</p>

<p>But the Rhodus game was not yet complete. The Mercantile
Finance Company, with its thousand-dollar capitalization
in the State of Maine, might get into difficulties transferring
stock to the "Independent Zinc," because somebody might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
know enough about Jasper County to realize that there was
not enough lead in that county outside the control of the
lead trust to make a small-sized pea.</p>

<p>Therefore it needed another company to "transfer" the
peevish stockholder to. So the Mexican Development Company
was formed by the Mercantile, the capital of the new company
being $1,000,000, and its assets 90,000 shares of the
"Mina Grande" stock, the par value of which would not buy
a cigarette paper.</p>

<p>The literature of the new company also carried the literature
of the "Mina Grande," with a glowing account of how the
new company was going to turn Mexico upside down and enrich
the whole world from the scorpion holes in the Sonora
hillsides.</p>

<p>The stockholders in the Mexican Development are still waiting
for returns on their investment. But the American people
were getting wise to the mining game, even when the magic
name of Jasper County was used. So to supplement Mexico
and Jasper County the Mercantile Finance Company, the old
reliable thousand-dollar concern, organized in rapid succession
the Boise King Placers Company, which was going to wash
fortunes out of the inoffensive mud of Idaho rivers, the Moose
Creek Placer Company, which had the same end in view, the
American Fibre Company, which had about as much fibre about
it as a paper candy box, The Illinois Finance Company (frenzied
finance, all right), The Indiana Securities Company, which
"secured" the money of the investor, but secured nothing else,
The Minnesota Securities Company, and then with a great
play to the galleries, The Finance Company of America.</p>

<p>From one to another of these absolutely bankrupt and worthless
concerns the investor was thrown back and forth like a
shuttlecock. If he was sore on Independent Zinc he got
American Finance. If he became convinced that American
Finance was worthless paper he got Idaho mud in the shape
of "Moose Creek Placers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span></p>

<p>Interest-bearing bonds with coupons attached were floated
on a number of these companies and sold largely through the
mails.</p>

<p>Just here Uncle Sam, urged on by reports made to the
Chicago Postoffice Inspectors by Wooldridge, took a hand.
When Wooldridge began boring in the bankers and other influential
friends of the Rhodus people, who had been wise
enough to get good political affiliations as an adjunct to their
business, became extremely busy and influences were brought to
bear to call Wooldridge off the case, because he was the most
feared man in America on a fraud game.</p>

<p>Wooldridge accepted the recall gracefully, but immediately
stepped over the way to the Federal Building, and called upon
Postoffice Inspector William Ketcham, who is acknowledged
by everyone in the secret service of the United States and the
general public to be the shrewdest, most astute, and most indefatigable
man in the service of the United States Government.
Wooldridge convinced the great inspector that there was something
doing in the "Rhodus" line. Ketcham complimented
Wooldridge highly on the manner in which he had gathered
the data together. Then Ketcham got busy himself. When
two such men as Wooldridge and Ketcham get busy it is not
long until the explosion comes.</p>

<p>Nor was it long coming in the Rhodus case. First came the
receivership of the Central Life Securities Company. And
here another big man and an incorruptible one got into the
game&mdash;none other than John C. Fetzer, founder of the "Fetzer
System" of receiverships that receive for the victims of defunct
concerns, in place of and for the receiver. This man was
fresh from the great Stensland Bank fraud, where as receiver
he had paid 72 cents on the dollar and wound up a
record receivership in less than one year, whereas the usual
time taken in such cases was ten years.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What is the poor beast to do?</span></div>
</div>

<p>When Fetzer's name appeared as receiver there was dismay
in the Rhodus camp. The triple combination was enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
frighten anyone, especially where the guilty conscience was a
factor. Fetzer immediately went to work. He called in his
fighting aids. He told Ketcham and Wooldridge to "keep it
up." When the Rhodus people began to give evasive answers
before the Referee in Bankruptcy, it was a short step, with
the information which had been gathered, to bring the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
before the Federal Grand Jury. And the indictments of the
Rhoduses followed.</p>

<p>The investigation of the Rhodus manner of doing business
showed that the shrewd manipulators of fish-worm holes
and scorpion nests had not neglected the feminine element.
The treasurer of the old thousand-dollar stand by hailing from
the pine tree state, the Mercantile Finance Company, was
Mary C. Scully, who had been with the Rhodus gang since
1894. Katherine T. Scully, a very young woman, who had
recently appeared on the scene, was listed as treasurer of the
good old "thousand-dollar" medium. She came into the secretaryship
as a result of a shuffle of officers of the Rhodus companies,
the shuffle of officials being found to be as necessary as
that of the shuffled stock.</p>

<p>It was also found that the Rhoduses came to Chicago about
1894 and organized the Western Mutual Life Association. This
company had a stormy career and was finally merged into the
Illinois Life Insurance Co. The methods of the Rhoduses were
severely criticised in connection with this company and all
confidence in it was destroyed.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to Chicago, Thomas and Birch F. Rhodus
operated a lottery at Denver, Colo., and in 1889 came in conflict
with the Federal authorities. Indictments are on record
against them and it is claimed that they used various aliases.
Thomas Rhodus was convicted at Denver in November, 1889,
and fined.</p>

<p>During the past four or five years the Mercantile Finance
Co. has offered the stock of numerous mining schemes, none
of which has shown any merit, but were officered and owned
by the Rhoduses and their associates. The methods employed
to sell stock in these enterprises were (according to bills filed
in court by the persons victimized) those of the ordinary swindler,
and a close study of the schemes and the manner in which
they are floated leads to the conclusion that the Rhoduses are
not entitled to any confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of going to press the Rhodus brothers are still
under indictment. The tangle in their affairs seems to show
conclusively that the matter will be long and bitterly fought,
but the facts that have come to light make matters look very
dark for the manipulators of the moss-grown stock-kiting game.</p>

<p>Samples of the literature secured by Wooldridge and Ketcham
prove very enlightening to the general public as to the methods
of the Rhodus' and kindred concerns. Here are a few of them:</p>

<p>"It is a rule of this company," one pamphlet of the company
reads, "not to act as fiscal agent for any corporation unless
this company is prominently represented in the management,
so as to be able to protect the interests of our clients."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Assurance Given Investors.</span></h3>

<p>The cover of the pamphlet bears the assurance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Are your interests protected? They are if made through
the Mercantile Finance Company. Avoid risk of loss; make
certain of gain."</p>
</div>

<p>On another page is a list of high-class railroad stocks to the
amount of $100,000 which the company is declared to be the
possessor of in addition to assets in stocks, mortgage loans,
cash on hand and other collateral. Careful reading of the
pamphlet, however, shows that these stocks are not a part of
the exchange list.</p>

<p>An explanation of the system, which probably will be a part
of the testimony submitted to the grand jury in conjunction
with the tales of luckless investors, as printed, is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Its plan is to create profits for its customers by aiding in
the intelligent development and working of legitimate mining
enterprises. Through this system its customers become careful
and conservative investors. Furthermore, they are given an opportunity
to participate in the vast wealth created in these industries,
having at the same time such assurance against loss
as would not otherwise be possible. It is a rule of this company
never to handle as a fiscal agent stock in any property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
until after a careful and thorough examination has been made.
It rejects those properties which do not come up to the high
standard required. This accomplishes for the customers what
the individual investor by himself, unaided, cannot afford to
do, for his own investment is usually too small to justify his
having this done on his own account.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purchases "Guaranteed."</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Mercantile Finance Company positively guarantees to
allow its customers the privilege of exchanging any stock purchased
from it for stock of any other company which may be
in the said guarantee fund. Such exchange may be made and
repeated as often as desired during a period of five years following
the date of the original purchase."</p>
</div>

<p>The tremendous activity of Inspector Ketcham, ably assisted
by Wooldridge, has been at the bottom of the exposure
of this whole abominable swindle. But this is by no means
the first case in which these two men have joined hands and
caused an upheaval in pseudo-financial circles.</p>

<p>These two men first began to work together in the famous
Wild Cat Insurance raids. These raids furnish one of the most
dramatic chapters in the financial history of the United States
if not of the world. The Wild Cats had stolen millions of
dollars. Their methods involved brutal filchings from the
poor, heartless commercial brigandage and finally the running
to earth and conviction of the ringleaders and promoters of
the concerns. The work was all done by Wooldridge and
Ketcham.</p>

<p>It would be improper to close the story of the great Rhodus
frauds without some mention of Attorney Patrick H. O'Donnell,
who, by his wise counsel and careful review of the matters submitted
in evidence, materially assisted the two men who had
most to do with the unearthing of the frauds.</p>

<h2><a id="WANT_AD_FAKERS">WANT AD. FAKERS.</a></h2>

<h3>THE PETTY DOLLAR SWINDLERS PUT OUT OF
BUSINESS IN CHICAGO BY DETECTIVE
CLIFTON R. WOOLDRIDGE.</h3>


<p>The cheap little grafter who takes dollars, dimes, nickels and
pennies from the poor, while not exactly a great financier, is
one of the smoothest propositions with which secret service men
and federal inspectors are confronted. His main hold is on
the public press, because he operates through the seemingly
innocuous want advertisement.</p>

<p>The statements of some advertisers may be taken literally;
some should be taken with caution, and some should not be
taken at all. In the postoffice department at Washington, in
the files of the assistant attorney general, one may study the
methods of the black sheep of the advertising fold against
whom fraud orders have been issued. A fraud order is an
order directed to a postmaster forbidding him to deliver letters
to a certain person or concern or to cash money orders for
them.</p>

<p>If a man swindles his neighbor without using the mails the
postoffice department will not interfere with him, although
the police may, but if he attempts to make Uncle Sam a party
to the swindle, the old gentleman lets loose on him a horde
of postoffice inspectors, who not only put a stop to the business,
but frequently put the swindler himself behind the bars.
The department issues year in and year out an average of one
fraud order a day, and an examination of the reports of the
inspectors who have investigated these cases is apt to convince
one that the long-accepted estimate that there is a sucker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
born every minute is much too low. The schemes most commonly
employed are here set forth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Home Work Scheme Catches Many.</span></h3>

<p>The chance to earn a few dollars a week without leaving
home appeals to many women whose household duties occupy
the greater part of their daylight hours. Unfortunately the
work-at-home scheme catches not only the woman whose object
is merely to earn a little pin money and who in many
cases can afford to lose a dollar or two without suffering any
hardship as a consequence, but it gathers in as well the working
girl eager to add to her scanty earnings by engaging in
some remunerative work at home.</p>

<p>The work-at-home scheme is operated in a variety of ways,
but the underlying principle is the same in all cases. Sometimes
the work to be done consists in embroidering doilies or
in making lace, and in other cases it consists in filling in
with gilt paint price tickets printed in outline. In all cases
the work is described as easy, the advertisements assuring the
reader that experience is unnecessary. In all cases, too, the
victim is obliged to buy, from the promoters of the scheme,
"materials" or a lace-making machine or some other object
before she is given any work. The following description of a
scheme against which a fraud order was issued last May will
make clear the methods pursued by all fakers of the work-at-home
class. The advertisement in this case reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><b>Home Work, $9 to $15; No Canvassing.</b></p>

<p><b>$5 to $6 weekly working evenings; experience unnecessary.
Inclose stamps for instructions, sample, etc. Address
B. Wilson &amp; Co., 603 Walnut street, Philadelphia,
Pa.</b></p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Money Charged for Fake "Outfits."</span></h3>

<p>To those who reply to this advertisement a circular letter is
sent stating that the work required consists in filling in with
bronze paint store-window price tickets printed in outline, one
of which, partly filled in, is inclosed as a sample.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/img133.jpg" width="384" height="500"
alt="If you don't know just where to go
Or how to do the thing that you
May have in mind&mdash;or if you find
That you can't rise&mdash;then advertise,
A &quot;Business Chances&quot; ad advances
Your desires to many buyers&mdash;
And our Want Ads, if you use them,
Bring so many&mdash;you can choose them." />
<div class="caption">
If you don't know just where to go<br />
Or how to do the thing that you<br />
May have in mind&mdash;or if you find<br />
That you can't rise&mdash;then advertise,<br />
A "Business Chances" ad advances<br />
Your desires to many buyers&mdash;<br />
And our Want Ads, if you use them,<br />
Bring so many&mdash;you can choose them.</div>
</div>


<p>The circular states that the work is easily done, requires
no previous experience, and that all that is necessary, is to
do the work in a neat manner. Two dollars and a half a
hundred is offered for tickets filled in as described, and the
prospective victim is assured that she can easily gild at least
100 tickets a day. She will require an "outfit," of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
the cost of which is generously put at the remarkably low
price of $1.10.</p>

<p>In return for her $1.10 the victim receives a handful of
window tickets, a small bottle of bronze paint, and a brush
for applying it&mdash;the actual value of the articles furnished,
including postage, being fully covered by the extra 10 cents.</p>

<p>The worst is yet to come. When the woman, having parted
with her money and having spent her time in filling in the
handful of tickets sent her, returns them, at her own expense,
she receives, not a check in payment for the work done, but
a circular letter stating that her work is "unsatisfactory." She
may possess the talent of a Rosa Bonheur and a department
store ticket writer rolled into one, but she will never succeed
in selling a cent's worth of bronzed price tickets to the fakers
who sold her the "outfit." Their business is not to buy but to
sell, and her fate is not to sell but to be sold. Similar to
the work-at-home scheme is what may be described as the
letter-writing dodge. The following is a typical advertisement
of its class:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>LADIES&mdash;Earn $20 per hundred writing short letters.
Stamped envelope for particulars. Gem Manufacturing
Company, Cassopolis, Mich.</b></p>
</div>

<p>When the woman anxious to earn an honest penny replies
to this ad. she receives the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Madam:</p>

<p>We pay at the rate of $20 per hundred or 20 cents for
each letter sent us in accordance with our printed circular
of instructions, and make remittances to you of all money
earned by you at the end of each week. The letter which we
send you to copy contains only eighty words, and can be
written either with typewriter or with pen and ink, as you
prefer, and you can readily see that you can write a number
of letters during your leisure time each day.</p>

<p>You do not pay us one penny for anything, except $1 for
the instructions and for packing and mailing the Ideal Hoodwinkem
which we send you.</p>

<p>There is no canvassing connected with the work, and if you
follow our instructions you can earn good wages from the
start.</p>
</div>

<p>When the victim sends her dollar for the instructions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
for the Ideal Hoodwinkem (or whatever the name of the article
the fakers are selling happens to be), she discovers that the
20 cents is not to be paid merely for writing a letter. Oh, no!
The 20 cents will be paid only for such letters as induce some
other woman to part with a dollar for one of "Our Ideal Hoodwinkems."
The following letter, which is sent after the unsuspecting
one's dollar has been safely salted down, lays bare
the true inwardness of the scheme:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Madam:</p>

<p>We herewith hand you trial blanks, also copy of letter which
you are to write. You are to send these letters out to ladies,
and for every letter which you write and send out and which
is returned to us with $1 inclosed for one of our Ideal Hoodwinkems,
with your number on the letter, we will send you a
cash commission of 20 cents.</p>
</div>

<p>It is needless to say that the fakers do not expect their
victim to be so stupid as to send out the letters on the terms
indicated. The object of the plan is accomplished when "dear
madam" parts with her dollar for the letter of instructions
and the Hoodwinkem, which would be dear at 10 cents.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Smooth Scheme.</span></h3>

<p>One of the simplest and most effective schemes for hooking
new "suckers" was adopted by a Dearborn street "investment"
concern. This consisted in sending to a prospective victim a
check for $100, made payable to some other man, and accompanied
by a brief letter telling that recipient would find inclosed
his weekly dividend on his investment of $1,000. Of
course the marked "sucker" knew nothing of the deal, and,
believing a mistake had been made would return the check
and letter. He at once received in reply an apologetic letter,
stating that the first letter and check had been inserted in the
wrong envelope through the carelessness of a clerk, it having
been the intention to mail to the recipient a circular instead
of another man's check for dividends. It was enough. Ten per
cent a week was not to be resisted. The "sucker" almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
invariably opened negotiations on his own initiative and was
landed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Financial "Journal" Frauds.</span></h3>

<p>The multiplicity of these schemes led to the establishment
of the "financial paper," designed, according to the publisher's
statement, to guard investors against get-rich-quick frauds. To
the police these papers are known as "special form papers."
The editor comprises the staff. The contents consist of financial
matter usually stolen from reputable journals, a formidable
array of financial advertising, and, most important, "reports"
on investment concerns. For a consideration the "special
form" paper tells its readers that the "Cotton Mutual
Investment Company" is sound and reliable. The manager
of the "Cotton Mutual" buys as many copies of the paper as
he wants, as it has no regular time of publication, and can
be run off in any quantity at any time with the article boosting
the "Cotton Mutual." The get-rich-quick manager then
sees to it that the paper finds its way into the hands of his
"sucker list," or list of names of persons whom he hopes to be
able to induce to "invest."</p>

<p>Therefore, when reading want ads. in the newspapers, consider
carefully the nature of the promises made. If they are
too rosy, too high-flown, have nothing to do with that ad. or
the man who inserted it. You may depend upon it that it is
a fake. There are no great armies of persons walking about
this country seeking to give away something for nothing.</p>

BROKER ARRESTED.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><b>Ramifications of the Bucket Shop System Revealed by
Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge.</b></p>


<p>George T. Sullivan, the millionaire stock, bond, grain and
cotton broker at 159-161 LaSalle street, Chicago, Illinois, was
arrested May 23, 1906, with 60 inmates. Twelve patrol wagon
loads of books, records and papers were seized and carted off to
the Harrison Street Police Station.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan at the time had one of the finest, best-equipped
offices in Chicago, which was located in the Traders' Building,
opposite the Chicago Board of Trade. He occupied several
floors, and they were very elaborately furnished. Part of
the third floor was used as a telegraph office, where forty men
were constantly at work at the telegraph keys. His private
telegraph wires reached from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean,
and from the Gulf of Mexico to the British possessions in the
north.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan paid to the Western Union Telegraph Company
for the privilege of using their wires and services $150,000
per year.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan had 111 branch offices, located in the principal
cities of the United States. Each of these branch offices
evidently was equipped with all the paraphernalia used in the
bucketshop, and was in charge of one of Mr. Sullivan's representatives.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan owned the entire equipments of the offices and
dictated the policy and work to each manager, which had to
be carried out to the letter. The following is a list of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>

<p>Chicago&mdash;225 Dearborn street, National Life Building, 16
Imperial Building, 51 Dexter Building, 84 Adams street,
South Chicago&mdash;9138 Commercial avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan had his correspondents and solicitors in all of
the leading stock, bond, grain and cotton markets of most of
the foreign countries. On May 23, 1903, he was doing a business
of from $300,000 to $500,000 per year. His weekly expenses
ran from $15,000 to $20,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan advertised extensively in the leading newspapers
throughout the United States and in foreign countries.
Many of his advertisements would cover an entire page. These
advertisements brought him many inquiries from persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
either through curiosity or desire to invest, saying nothing of
the cash customers secured.</p>

RED LETTER TIPS</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Sullivan made special effort to buy or acquire every
mailing list to be found in the entire country which had been
used by other fraudulent and get-rich-quick concerns.</p>

<p>It is said that he had secured over 20,000 names, which he
had on his mailing list. These men were bombarded from
day to day with his literature and his <em class="italic">red-letters</em>, giving the
forecast of the market. These letters were very ingeniously
gotten up by himself and a clairvoyant fortune teller named
Madame Dunbar.</p>

<p>His methods were absolutely devoid of even a pretense of
sound business ethics, sensationalism and red ink being his
only stock in trade.</p>

<p>The class of literature and telegrams he sent broadcast and
regardless of expense is well illustrated by the following:</p>

<p>Telegram sent January 1, 1903, to hundreds of persons
throughout the country:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Am going to run three-cent turn in May wheat. Let me
act for you heavy. I will take loss if any. Mail three-cent
margin.</p>

<p class="author">
George T. Sullivan."</p>
</div>

<p>In his "Red Letter" of May 18 he makes the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is only one thong about this wheat, and that is, a
bull market is at hand; and those who buy cannot lose, and if
they buy on my advice and buy quickly, I will pay the loss if
there should be any."</p>
</div>

<p>He had four offices in Chicago aside from his main office,
these being designated by him as "Exclusive Offices for Lady
Speculators." When about to open one of these offices he
addressed a circular letter to the wives of many prominent
citizens announcing the opening of same. The first paragraph
of this letter reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have opened superbly appointed offices on the ground floor
of the National Life Building, Room 120, where I accept accounts
from ladies of $100 or upwards for marginal speculation
in stocks, bonds, grain and cotton.</p>

"George T. Sullivan."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

<p>George T. Sullivan, who frequently signs himself "Red Letter
Sullivan," is by occupation a telegraph operator. He was
first heard of in Boston during the year 1899 and the early
part of 1900.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">On the "Oil Exchange."</span></h3>

<p>On May 17, 1900, Sullivan was admitted as a member of
the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange of New York
and under the firm name of Sullivan &amp; Sullivan advertised
extensively and had a system of wires through New England.
It was noticed that his business on the exchange was very
small and upon the complaint of a customer his trading methods
were investigated, with the result that on the 11th of
October he was adjudged guilty of obvious fraud or false pretenses
and expelled from membership in the exchange. He
made some threats of a suit against the exchange, but the firm
of Sullivan &amp; Sullivan failed in November and nothing was
heard of him in New York. His customers and correspondents
never received any statements of their accounts and Sullivan
fled the state.</p>

<p>He seems to have come direct to Chicago, and was employed
for several months by bucketshops and private-wire houses as
a telegraph operator.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1901 he associated himself with E. F. Rowland,
ostensibly to do a commission business in stocks, grain and cotton.
His methods of advertising were extremely lurid, and
he flooded the country with literature and letters printed in
red ink. The employee, Sullivan, soon forced Rowland out
of business and continued under the name of Rowland until
the first of January, 1903, when by degrees he had worked the
name of Sullivan into prominence and the name of Rowland
had gradually been eliminated from his signs and literature.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reasons Which Caused Investigation, Raid and Arrest.</span></h3>

<p>The raid by Detective C. R. Wooldridge on the Lincoln
Commission Company, a race track scheme, in the Portland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
Block, 115 Dearborn street, May 14, 1903, developed the peculiar
relations between this concern and Sullivan, and the
police department was somewhat astounded to find among the
papers of the Lincoln Commission Company conclusive evidence,
in the shape of telegrams and correspondence, proving
that Sullivan's agents on his private wires were acting as
the agents of the turf scheme, and that the employees and
private wires of the Sullivan concern were used in common
by the Lincoln Commission Company with the consent and
approval of Sullivan.</p>

<p>More than twenty of Sullivan's agents were posting in his
various offices the tips sent out by the Lincoln Commission
Company and accepting bets which were transmitted over Sullivan's
wires to be placed ostensibly by the Lincoln Commission
Company on the horses which they tipped off as sure
winners.</p>

<p>The mixing up of a turf scheme with a so-called grain and
stock business was something new to the police, and Detective
Wooldridge prosecuted the investigation, and, upon becoming
fully acquainted with Sullivan's methods, concluded that he
was not only running a bucketshop, but was interested in the
turf scheme to a greater extent.</p>

<p>The evidence gathered in the raid on the Lincoln Commission
Company fully established the fact. The Cook County
Grand Jury was in session at the time and the evidence was
presented to them. Detective Wooldridge was ordered to make
a full investigation and report to them, which he did.</p>

<p>The Grand Jury instructed Wooldridge to lay the matter
before the General Superintendent of Police, Francis O'Neill,
and say: "The Grand Jury requested immediate action should
be taken by the police to enforce the state law, which was
being violated."</p>

<p>Wooldridge submitted the case to Chief O'Neill. He asked
if Wooldridge had secured the necessary evidence to prove that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
Sullivan was conducting an illegitimate business. He was answered
in the affirmative.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wooldridge's Raid.</span></h3>

<p>On the morning of May 23, 1903, ten picked detectives
were secured from the Detective Bureau to accompany Wooldridge
in the raid on George T. Sullivan, which turned out to
be one of the largest as well as one of the most sensational
raids and arrests that had occurred in Chicago for years.</p>

<p>Sullivan did an extensive business. The offices of the company
which were raided were elaborately furnished, and there
was a complete assortment of tickers, blackboards and like
paraphernalia. At the time of the raid the offices were crowded,
the operations on the open board and the Board of Trade being
remarkably exciting. The officers who assisted Wooldridge
in the raid were Detective Sergeants Howe, Mullen, Quinn,
Qualey, Miskel, McLaughlin, Weber, Flint and McLane.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Offices Filled with Patrons.</span></h3>

<p>It was at 10 o'clock in the morning, when the largest throng
of speculators can be found in the offices at 259-261 LaSalle
street, opposite the Board of Trade, that Wooldridge and his
men swooped down on the place and proclaimed "every one
there a patron of a bucketshop and under arrest."</p>

<p>The wildest excitement prevailed. Telegraph operators,
messenger boys, pit men and persons of every station in life
were caught. Some of the traders, thinking of their wives and
children, pleaded frantically for their freedom. Some attempted
to force their way from the betting rooms, but, meeting
with armed resistance, they desisted.</p>

<p>"I don't belong here," said one man, indignantly. "I only
dropped in here to see a friend." His plea was unavailing.</p>

<p>Another man, attired in a frock coat and a silk hat, attempted
to bribe one of the detectives. "I can't have it get out that
I was arrested," said he. "State your price and I will give
it to you gladly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>The only persons allowed to escape were three women stenographers,
who fled through a rear window.</p>

<p>Advertising matter, private correspondence, telephones, tickers,
telegraph instruments and everything of consequence was
seized and loaded into twelve patrol wagons and taken to the
Harrison Street Police Station.</p>

<p>Four hundred and twenty telegraph wires were cut which
connected Sullivan's bucketshops in Chicago and through the
country. It took the Western Union Telegraph Company two
weeks to get the wires in working order.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Names of Prisoners Arrested.</span></h3>

<p>At the Harrison Street Police Station those arrested in the
raid gave their names as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>G. T. Sullivan, W. D. Hart, John Conway, L. J. Hoff,
Charles Barth, William Wilson, E. E. Matwell, J. A. Hogadorn,

John P. Garrison, Al. Dewes, Elmer C. Huntley, T. A.
Duey.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crowd Gathers.</span></h3>

<p>The fact that a raid was being made became known outside
the offices and in a short time several thousand persons gathered.
Crowds peered through the windows and doors. The Chicago
Open Board of Trade is directly across the alley in the rear
of Sullivan's offices, and business there was at a standstill for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
a time. The traders gathered about Sullivan's offices and remained
until the last prisoner had been taken away in the
patrol wagon.</p>

<p>Sullivan himself was in his private office when the raid was
made. Wooldridge broke open the door and faced the man at
the desk.</p>

<p>"You are under arrest, Mr. Sullivan," said the detective.
Sullivan grew pale and then reached his hand to the telegraph
instrument which stood on the table. He started to work it.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" ordered Wooldridge. But Sullivan continued.
Wooldridge made a leap for the trader and forced him away
from the instrument. But the trader was not to be thwarted.
He reached over the detective's shoulder, and again the click
began. Wooldridge then seized the instrument and hurled it
into the desk.</p>

<p>"Cut all telephone and telegraph wires," was the order given
by Wooldridge, and the frenzied occupants of the place were
thrown into terror. There was a mad rush for the door, but
the detectives stood in the way. Every inducement was offered
the policemen, but efforts failed.</p>

<p>Then Sullivan claimed that he had an injunction issued by
Judge Elbridge Hanecy forbidding the police from raiding his
place.</p>

<p>"I have an injunction from Judge Hanecy to stop you!"
yelled Sullivan. "Show me the injunction, then," replied
Wooldridge, "and I will obey it. If not, I am an officer of the
court and have warrants here charging you with keeping a
bucketshop and gambling house."</p>

<p>The injunction which Sullivan claimed to have was found
by the police in one of his drawers in blank form, without any
signature, together with the following letter to one of his
managers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="author">
May 19, 1903.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Charles A. Warren</span>,<br />
<span class="i2">New York.</span>
</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Warren:</p>

<p>Your friend Wooldridge was in all day Monday. We had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
four detectives here all day investigating my guarantee plan,
and they showed up again today and held several conversations
with Miss Lorentzen before we realized who they were.
It looks like they were trying to make a case.</p>

<p>In looking up the injunction papers, find you neglected to
change them to read The George T. Sullivan Company and
The George T. Sullivan Elevator &amp; Grain Co. I took them
to Morris and he rehearsed them, patched them, etc., and they
are now ready to play ball with.</p>

<p>Morris is very busy and it looks as if we might need someone
else on the scene of action to watch things.</p>

<p>Hope you arrived O. K., and with best wishes, I remain,</p>

<p class="author">
Yours very truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">George T. Sullivan</span>.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>However, it was not until 11 o'clock and more than an hour
after the raid had been made that Attorney Edward Morris
filed the injunction bill in the Circuit Court.</p>

<p>The injunction was finally issued by Judge Abner Smith at
12:30 o'clock. It restrained Chief O'Neill and Detectives
Hertz and Wooldridge from interfering in any way with the
property contained in the offices occupied by the concern or
cutting the telegraph wires leading to them. It is represented
in the bill that the company has offices at 259 LaSalle street,
Bush Temple of Music, 60 LaSalle street, 16 Imperial Building
and 84 Adams street; but the damage had already been
done.</p>

<p>Sullivan was practically out of business, and was being bombarded
and seized by a horde of infuriated patrons who demanded
their money, entrusted to him to invest. Sullivan
could not return the money, as he had spent it and was
bankrupt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">"Red Letter" Well Known.<br />
Patrons Told They Would Not Lose If Advice Was Followed.</span></h3>

<p>In Sullivan's office the detectives found great quantities of
advertising matter. This matter was thoroughly gone over in
the search for evidence against the grain and stock broker.
Pile after pile of Sullivan's "red letter" circulars were found.</p>

<p>Sullivan's "red letter" was issued daily, and printed in red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
ink. The circulars were written in a manner characteristic
of all the advertisements, printed matter and correspondence
to patrons.</p>

<p>In telegrams to patrons and the "red letters" Sullivan often
made the proposition that he would make good all loss sustained
by patrons while they were making purchases upon his
advice.</p>

<p>The detectives were somewhat surprised when they saw at
the top of the circular in bold, red type that "four exclusive
offices for lady speculators" were being operated in Chicago,
one in South Chicago and one in St. Louis. The addresses
given for the Chicago offices were 225 Dearborn street, 159
LaSalle street, 260 Clark street and 84 Adams street. Women
speculators of South Chicago had the opportunity of making
their purchases at 9138 Commercial avenue.</p>

<p>Wooldridge was asked by the press what justification he
had in making the raids, and by whose orders they were made.
He said that he raided the Lincoln Commission Company at
115 Dearborn street, May 14, 1903, which was conducting a
turf investment company, and found that George T. Sullivan
was operating the same in connection with his bucketshop;
that George T. Sullivan and 60 inmates were arrested, and
eleven wagon loads of books, letters, papers and records taken
to the Harrison Street Police Station. Wooldridge said that
he had evidence to indict them on 50 charges, and he intended
to deliver the goods, and he would not be pulled off by any
man in the State of Illinois.</p>

<p>Wooldridge immediately took steps to get his evidence in
shape. He called on John Hill, Jr., who had charge of the
Board of Trade quotations and who was an expert on bucketshop
methods.</p>

<p>Wooldridge, Hill and two clerks went to work gathering
evidence for the trial; eleven wagon loads of books, papers,
letters and records had to be gone through, which was done
in the most careful, systematic manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span></p>

<p>They worked from 2 p. m. until 12 o'clock and the evidence
gathered was placed in a vault.</p>

<p>After they had secured something to eat in a nearby restaurant
and taken two hours' sleep, they resumed their work,
which was carried on until 7 o'clock Sunday morning. This
evidence which was secured was locked up in another vault
for safe keeping. After they had eaten their breakfast they
resumed work again and worked until 6 p. m. This evidence
gathered was placed in another vault. After they had eaten
their supper they resumed work again and worked until 1
o'clock Sunday night, when they succeeded in going through
every scrap of paper which was seized in the raid. This evidence
gathered was placed in another vault.</p>

<p>The placing of this evidence in different vaults was for the
purpose of preventing George T. Sullivan or any of his friends
from securing it on a writ of replevin.</p>

<p>Wooldridge slept until 5 o'clock, then went to the residence
of Charles S. Deneen, State's Attorney. Arriving at his house
and finding that he had not arisen from bed, Wooldridge
pulled up a settee which he found on the veranda and placed it
in front of his door where it would be impossible for him to
get out of his house without first awaking Wooldridge.</p>

<p>Wooldridge laid down and went fast asleep and was found
there when State's Attorney Deneen was making his departure
next morning for his office. Wooldridge, upon being aroused
from his sleep, told Mr. Deneen of the raid made and the
evidence gathered and showed him some 10 or 15 telegrams from
reputable Board of Trade men who were worth over $20,000,000
collectively. The substance of the telegrams was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Officer Clifton R. Wooldridge: We are informed that you
raided George T. Sullivan's bucketshop. You have done your
duty and been criticised and assailed for doing it. My name
is &mdash;&mdash; and my attorneys name is &mdash;&mdash; and we are at your service
night or day, without any expense to you."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Deneen asked Wooldridge how soon he would be ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
to present his evidence to the Grand Jury. Wooldridge replied
that he had two cases already prepared before he made the
raid and would be ready in six hours with a number of additional
cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Deneen told Wooldridge to accompany him to his office,
which was done. He called Assistant State's Attorneys Albert
C. Barnes, F. L. Barnett and Howard O. Sprogle and instructed
them to assist Wooldridge in preparing the cases for
the Grand Jury and give him a clean road just the minute he
was ready. They were further instructed to give him all the
assistance and advice he should need in the matter.</p>

<p>The special complaints were drawn, the telegraph wires became
busy and at 10 o'clock Wooldridge and witnesses went
before the Grand Jury and George T. Sullivan was indicted for
keeping a bucketshop and common gaming house.</p>

<p>George T. Sullivan was also active from Saturday until
Monday morning. He had prepared writs of replevin and
warrants for larceny for Wooldridge and officers who were with
him.</p>

<p>Wooldridge was called up over the telephone by Sullivan's
friends and offered a bribe of $5,000 if he would release and
turn over the books, letters and records which were seized in
the raid, so Sullivan could resume business. This offer was
refused by Wooldridge and the matter reported to the State's
Attorney.</p>

<p>Sullivan then resorted to sending various friends and powerful
politicians for the paraphernalia seized. Still Wooldridge
turned a deaf ear to their requests and entreaties.</p>

<p>Wooldridge was a very busy man at the County Court Building
on Monday. Before the George T. Sullivan bucketshop
raid and the indictment before the Grand Jury, Wooldridge
had the case of J. J. Jacobs, manager of the Montana Mining,
Loan &amp; Investment Company, which was a lottery, on trial
before Judge Chetlain.</p>

<p>While in the courtroom he was informed by officers that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
had a writ of replevin for the goods seized in Sullivan's bucketshop;
that they also held warrants for Wooldridge and the
officers who were with him, but if he would surrender the goods
seized they declared the warrants would not be served and
there would be no trouble.</p>

<p>Wooldridge called on the State's Attorney and informed him
of the demand made upon him. State's Attorney Deneen
called the officers in his office and told them that Wooldridge
was there in attendance in the court and he would not permit
the warrants to be served on him until after court adjourned.
Further, he had instructed Wooldridge not to turn over any
of the property.</p>

<p>Sullivan during the meantime had learned that there was
an indictment against him by the Grand Jury and withdrew
the order for serving of the warrants. He was indicted, convicted
and paid a $500 fine.</p>

<p>After the police had secured the evidence, his books, letters
and records were returned to him. He tried to start up in
business again; also to get other parties interested with him
who had money, but in this he failed. He was forced to
refund $150,000 to his patrons who had advanced money to
him to speculate in grain and stock. He expected financial
assistance and hoped to resume business, but nothing materialized.</p>

<p>There were thousands of other creditors throughout the
country who were not so fortunate in obtaining a settlement.
These creditors combined and forced him into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>He was then cited in the United States Court for violating
a federal injunction.</p>

<p>He quietly folded his tent at night and left Chicago without
leaving his address. He was next heard of in England
six months later. All traces of him were lost until, in August,
1907, at Pittsburg, Pa., he was arrested for running a bucketshop.</p>

<p>George T. Sullivan, of George T. Sullivan &amp; Co., brokers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
with offices in the Bijou Building, Pittsburg, and was arraigned
before Magistrate F. J. Brady at Central Police Station,
charged with a misdemeanor and violating a city ordinance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sullivan Has Record.</span></h3>

<p>The misdemeanor was based on Sullivan's doing business
without being properly registered at Harrisburg, and he was
charged with violating a city ordinance for running a brokerage
office without taking out a city license. He was held, for
court in $1,000 bail on the misdemeanor charge and was fined
$25 on the other.</p>

<p>George T. Sullivan, the Napoleon of frenzied finance, cut
a large figure in Chicago. From a telegraph operator in the
pool rooms and bucketshops at a salary of $18 per week, he acquired
enough in the short space of two years to own and
operate the largest bucketshop in the United States.</p>

<p>He soared high in the money circles, but at last was brought
crashing to the earth, a financial wreck. He was convicted
of keeping a bucketshop and gambling house. He went bankrupt,
hounded to death by his creditors, many of whom he
had wrecked.</p>

<p>He was cited to appear in the United States Court for violating
an injunction, and warrants had been sworn out by the
postal authorities for using the mails to defraud the public.</p>

<p>He took his freight from Chicago to new fields of pasture.
Wine, women and high financing brought his downfall.</p>

<p>The murder of Webster Guerin occurred on the morning
of February 21, 1906, at his office, room 703 Omaha Building,
134 Van Buren street.</p>

<p>Detectives Clifton R. Wooldridge and J. P. Daugherty were
on their way to see Guerin about a complaint made against
him when they ran into the shooting. They had been there
before, but were not able to find the man. Under the name
of Fisher, Guerin had another office in the same building. The
complaint was from Mrs. G. Boynton, 903 East Fifty-fifth
street, who said she had been forced into buying a picture
frame through the promise of the managers of the Harrison
Art Studio that they would enlarge the picture free of charge.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the building Detectives Wooldridge and
Daugherty heard a pistol shot ring out which sounded as if
coming from the upper story of the building. Springing into
the elevator, they soon reached the top floor, where they were
directed to room 703, where a number of the tenants of the
building had already gathered. Stretched upon the floor lay
the body of Webster Guerin with the blood oozing from his
mouth and a bullet wound from a 32-caliber revolver on the
left side, just above the heart; the bullet had passed through
his lungs and caused a hemorrhage; from his mouth came
nearly one-half gallon of blood.</p>

<p>When Wooldridge and Daugherty reached the side of Guerin
he was past human aid.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">No Witnesses of Killing.</span></h3>

<p>There were no witnesses of the killing of Guerin. He was
in his office with Mrs. Dora McDonald. Several persons heard a
shot, and a moment later the glass door was broken and the
head of Mrs. McDonald came out.</p>

<p>The condition of the studio, in room 703 of the Omaha
Building, shows that a violent quarrel took place between
Guerin and Mrs. McDonald. Mrs. McDonald left her residence
shortly after breakfast. She arrived at the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
about 11:45 o'clock. Guerin expected her, for he told his
office boy, Thomas Hanson, who lives at 265 West Ohio street,
to leave the room and not come back until 1 o'clock. Before
the boy left the room Mrs. McDonald entered and the two immediately
began quarreling, it is said. Guerin shouted to
Hanson to leave and nothing more was heard until the shooting
at 11:50 o'clock.</p>

<p>Lorenzo Blasi, who lives at 73 West Ohio street, and who is
employed in room 608 of the same building, heard the shot and
the sound of breaking glass. He was in the corridor on the
seventh floor. He hurried to the scene and on the way heard
the glass breaking again and a woman screaming: "He shot
himself! He shot himself!"</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Woman Cut by Broken Glass.</span></h3>

<p>When Blasi reached the studio he found Mrs. McDonald with
her head partly thrust through the broken glass. Her face
was bleeding from cuts. In her hand she held a revolver. She
was trying to break more of the glass with her revolver and
escape.</p>

<p>A moment later Eric Allert and Charles B. Williams, who
work across the corridor, rushed out to Blasi's aid.</p>

<p>Mrs. McDonald was pulled through the door and the revolver
was secured. In the office, men found Guerin lying dead in
the room leading off from the main part of the office.</p>

<p>A torn picture and some hatpins were on the floor. There
were finger marks on her throat.</p>

<p>When Dora McDonald recovered consciousness she shrieked:
"Oh, God! Get a doctor; he has shot himself."</p>

<p>Where the revolver may have been at that time it was difficult
to say. Several witnesses said that it was lying at the
right side of Guerin, who was dying. Others said that the
woman held it in her hand, waving it above her head as she
screamed out: "He has shot himself."</p>

<p>Who this strong, handsomely garbed woman was who had
either witnessed a suicide, committed a murder or participated
in an accident no one knew, but she was hurried off to the
police station by Detective Wooldridge.</p>

<p>"Daddy, oh, daddy, forgive me!" she kept screaming out.
She was recognized, however, and it was found that "Daddy"
could be none other than the big gambler and political boss,
Mike McDonald. So they sent for Mike, and he gathered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
his arms the woman who in that moment broke his heart and
sent him to his grave in sorrow.</p>

<p>An inquest was begun before Coroner Peter J. Hoffman in
the Harrison Street Station on March 1, 1906. After five
days an open verdict was returned, in which the jurors declared
themselves unable to determine the cause of the death
of Guerin.</p>

<p>The Coroner's jury consisted of the following named persons:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Joseph Willis, 43 Cass street; Frank O. Borhyar, 6142 Madison
avenue; William Merker, 263 Seminary avenue; William
C. Hollens, 6418 Rhodes avenue; David A. Smith, 3843 California
avenue; George F. Cram, 4166 Drexel boulevard.</p>
</div>

<p>On March 16, Municipal Judge Newcomer went to the jail
hospital, where Dora McDonald, still in bed, was formally arraigned
and held on a charge of murder. Two weeks later
she was indicted by the Grand Jury.</p>

<p>All of the evidence so gathered was embodied in the report
of the Coroner, and the names of the witnesses were thereto
attached, all of which were made public at the time. The
State and the defense secured a copy of the same.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mystery Too Much for Coroner.</span></h3>

<p>All the additional evidence and the preparation of the case
was made by the State's attorneys, William H. Rittenhouse.
Edwin S. Day, Frank Comerford, City Police Attorney, and
other officers. All the names of new witnesses (some twelve
or fifteen in number) and the evidence were concealed from
Detective Wooldridge, and at no time was he present, or did
he hear to what the witnesses would testify. Therefore, he
had no knowledge of any new facts when the case was called
for trial.</p>

<p>The mystery of Guerin's death proved too much for a Coroner's
jury. More than two weeks after the artist was slain
the Coroner's panel returned an open verdict. It merely
found that Guerin had died from a bullet wound in a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
which the jury was unable to determine. This same verdict
Colonel Lewis sought to introduce at the trial in Judge Brentano's
court. Such a move was new in criminal annals, and
it was some time before the court decided that it should be
ruled out.</p>

<p>Mrs. McDonald was meantime transferred to the County
Jail from the Harrison Street Station. She was broken in
health and a confirmed invalid. Two persons, however, were
faithful to her, Mike McDonald and Miss Amanda Beck, her
nurse.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Friends Get Busy Quickly.</span></h3>

<p>A few hours after the tragedy of Webster Guerin all the
influences and machinery at the command of Mike McDonald
were brought to bear to save the life of Dora McDonald. A. S.
Trude, one of the greatest criminal attorneys in Chicago, was
employed, besides several other noted lawyers, to defend Dora
McDonald. Mike McDonald's political friends soon became
active. Everything was done to gather evidence in Dora McDonald's
case, and everything was done that could be done to
suppress any evidence that was injurious to her.</p>

<p>There was one witness who was greatly feared, and that
was Detective Clifton R. Wooldridge, who made the arrest.</p>

<p>Several days after the shooting A. S. Trude, Mike McDonald's
attorney, met Wooldridge in the Criminal Court and
shook hands with him. He said that he was very glad that
Wooldridge was interested in the case for one reason, for he
knew he would get a square deal. He also stated that there
was another reason why he was sorry that Wooldridge was in
the case, because he had too many eyes and too many feet to be
on the opposite side of any case in which he (Trude) was
interested. This view was shared by Mike McDonald and his
friends, who became active to get Wooldridge out of the way.</p>

<p>Mike McDonald first paid a visit to John M. Collins, then
General Superintendent of Police, and one of his warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
personal friends, and Frank Comerford, City Police Attorney.
What occurred in that office will never be known, unless Collins
chooses to make a statement, as McDonald has since died.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge was called to the office of John M.
Collins, General Superintendent of Police, and told not to
talk to any newspaper men or anyone else about the McDonald
case. He was further told not to make himself too officious,
and not to be too active in the case.</p>

<p>Several days later he was again called to Chief Collins' office
and told that Frank Comerford, then acting as City Police
Attorney, and a warm friend of Mike McDonald's, was to
take charge of the case, so that he need not bother himself
further with the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Comerford became very active, securing the names of
all the witnesses and all evidence to which they would testify,
together with other facts. All this matter eventually found
its way into the hands of the defense long before the trial.</p>

<p>Mike McDonald and his friends thought that Wooldridge
would become active again in the case. Therefore Mike proceeded
to get busy himself. No one seems to know the ins and
outs of the case, but it is nevertheless a fact that soon after
the election of April, 1907, Wooldridge was transferred from
the office of the General Superintendent of Police, where he
had served since 1889, to the Cottage Grove Avenue Station.
No reason was assigned for this transfer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Guerin's Life Story.</span></h3>

<p>Webster Guerin, who lived at 655 West Harrison street, was
well known on the West Side, where he was born thirty years
ago. He kept a haberdashery on West Madison street a few
years before the murder, but left it to go to California. On
his return he went into the picture business. Guerin was a
tall, splendid-looking fellow more than six feet in height.</p>

<p>Guerin was known at the offices in the Omaha Building as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
Louis Fisher, and it was under that name that he operated the
Harrison Art Company.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dora McDonald Divorced Wife of "Sam" Barclay.</span></h3>

<p>Dora McDonald, 35 years old, was the divorced wife of "Sam"
Barclay, a former professional ball player and Chicago saloonkeeper.
They had one son, Harold Barclay, who was later
legally adopted by "Mike" McDonald, and who was at school
in Florida at the time of the murder. He was 15 years old.</p>

<p>She had separated from Barclay shortly prior to her divorce
and had been on the stage for a short time under the name
of Mme. Alberta. She was married to Mike McDonald a week
after her divorce and was taken by him to his home at Harrison
street and Ashland avenue.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beauty of West Side.</span></h3>

<p>Dora McDonald was one of the beauties of the West Side
in her day, and many admirers hovered about her threshold.
The lights of the midnight hours charmed her then, and she
dashed off to marry Sam Barclay, a professional baseball
player.</p>

<p>Into that home came Michael Cassius McDonald. He was
a gambler and a politician and a man of great wealth.</p>

<p>For the second time his wife had left him; run away, people
said, with a man who had been a guest at their home.</p>

<p>Mike was lonesome. He saw the bride of Sam Barclay and
loved her. He dined with her, and perhaps he paid for her
divorce trial. At least she separated from Barclay and when
Mike went a-wooing again he won this pretty woman.</p>

<p>In a west side home of some pretensions Mike established
his new wife. He thought so much of her that he sent his
sons away when she could not agree with them. He gave her
money and finery and servants and carriages, and thought that
she ought to be happy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boy of 14 Enters.</span></h3>

<p>Webster Guerin lived across the street. He was a boy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
attractive manners and he won the affection of Dora McDonald.</p>

<p>Slander gives one reason for that affection; the woman gives
another.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stole Him as a Boy, Slew Him as a Man, Says Archie
Guerin.</span></h3>

<p>Archie Guerin, Webster Guerin's brother, told how Mrs.
Dora McDonald had taken a violent fancy to Webster when he
was a boy of 14, and Archie 13, or thereabouts; how she would
meet them on their way home from school and whisk Webster
into the mansion, keeping him two, three or four hours; how
she used to waylay Webster on his way home from church; how
she followed him through the years until she got the notion
that he was falling in love with Avis Dargan; how she put
detectives on the boy's trail and sat for hours in a cab opposite
the Omaha Building to see whether Miss Dargan entered; how
she threatened to shoot him; how she would break out into
wild and vehement declarations of her love, wailing that she
"worshiped every hair of his head," and that she would kill
him before she would lose him.</p>

<p>How she came into the studio on the day Webster was shot,
asserting that she had "told that old slob everything" (meaning
her husband), and said she was going to New York; how Webster
had replied that he was "through with her," to which she
retorted, "I am not through with you; do you think I would
kill myself without first putting a bullet into your head?"
How Mrs. McDonald had requested him to leave the studio,
and how he had refused to do so until Webster joined his request
to hers; how Archie and the two boys employed in the
studio had gone away and left them to act out the tragedy by
themselves behind doors that were closed and locked; how
Archie had gone to the Windsor Clifton Hotel to meet Harry
Feldman, with whom he had a business appointment; how
Feldman had become alarmed when he heard that Mrs. McDonald
and Webster were alone in the studio, urging Archie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
to call Webster on the telephone; how he and Archie stepped
to the 'phone, called up the studio, and after a gruff "hello"
from a policeman got back the staggering news: "Your brother
has been murdered."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mike McDonald Deluded by Wife.</span></h3>

<p>"Mike" seemingly was deluded. He may have had suspicions
of his wife, but his suspicions seem to have been quieted by
the woman.</p>

<p>Even when Guerin followed her to California she dared to
wire Mike: "Web Guerin is coming; fear I shall be compromised;
shall I come back?"</p>

<p>It was such a frank admission that the gambler urged her
to have mettle. "Stick," he sent back word. "Don't let anyone
bluff you."</p>

<p>Things went on this way until the morning of February 21,
1906. Then something happened, the climax occurred and
Guerin was shot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Provides for the Defense.</span></h3>

<p>After the arrest of his wife, "Mike" McDonald announced
that he believed in her integrity and declared he would spend
every cent of his fortune to save her. The former gambling
dictator was almost 70 years old and his health was failing
rapidly. Four months after the event he was taken to the
St. Anthony de Padua Hospital, where he remained until his
death, August 9, 1907.</p>

<p>McDonald was still passing to his death when there crept
into his room a little, white-haired woman who had come from
Newark, N. J. There she was known as Mrs. Grashoff and a
great charity worker, especially in the interest of fallen girls
in the Crittenden homes. Years before Mike McDonald had
called her his first wife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dramatic Meeting of McDonald and First Wife.</span></h3>

<p>By the laws of the church she was still his wife, no matter
what the years had brought forth. So Mike took her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
and held it and spoke softly to her in a breath of full forgiveness
and passed away. Without the door sat the woman whom
he had called his wife&mdash;Dora, whom he had won from a husband
and to whom he had been faithful until he stepped to
the brink of his grave.</p>

<p>This was the last straw that crushed the spirit of Dora
McDonald.</p>

<p>The body of Webster Guerin was removed to McNally &amp;
Duffy's undertaking rooms at 516 Wabash avenue.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge took up the work of gathering the
evidence and prepared the case for the Coroner and Grand
Jury.</p>

<p>The Grand Jury indictment placed Dora McDonald seemingly
beyond the pale of bail, but Mike worked assiduously and
finally secured her release from prison on $50,000 bonds. Then
Mike became ill and died in St. Anthony's Hospital.</p>

<p>Before he gave way to his broken heart McDonald drew up
a will. He set aside a defense fund with which the woman
might be given adequate chance for freedom in the court, and
left her "such rights and only such rights as she may be entitled
to as widow."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Trial Begins.</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. McDonald was put on trial January 20. The jury was
completed January 25 and the taking of testimony began at
once. The case of the State was made as complete as possible
and the defense began an exhaustive array of testimony. The
defense, however, came to a surprisingly sudden end. It had
been feared that Mrs. McDonald might not live through the
trial and there was every desire to have a verdict before she
might give way to heart trouble.</p>

<p>The case was heard before Judge Theodore Brentano, and it
lasted twenty-one days.</p>

<p>Dora McDonald was represented by Colonel James Hamilton
Lewis, Chief Assistant Patrick H. O'Donnell, Attorneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span> Benjamin
M. Shaffner, Frank R. Cain, Gabriel Norden, Clarence
Shaffner and Forest G. Smith.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Packed Courtroom.</span></h3>

<p>With the courtroom packed to the doors and several hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
men and women struggling to gain admission, the actual trial
of Mrs. Dora McDonald, widow of Mike McDonald, commenced.
Assistant State's Attorney Edward S. Day made an
opening statement of the case. Trembling and his eyes flashing,
he pointed a finger at Mrs. Dora McDonald and in a ringing
voice denounced her as the murderess of Guerin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Dora McDonald became acquainted with Guerin, who was
about 14 years old. His parents lived a short distance from
the McDonald home.</p>

<p>"A friendship between Mrs. McDonald and the boy began,
which his mother and other relatives later tried to end. Three
years later the McDonalds removed to the Drexel boulevard
home, but the intimacy of Webster Guerin and Mrs. McDonald
continued.</p>

<p>"At any event, as time passed on, dealing meantime gently
with the woman and developing Web into a young man of more
than six feet in height, the two were seen frequently together.
Relatives of both testified that the two kissed each other; that
at times Mrs. McDonald grew jealous, in all apparent intent,
over him; that she wrote poems and set them to music to show
what seemed to be the very depths of a despairing heart.</p>

<p>"The woman was insanely jealous over him." "He had wandered
out from her love into the light of other women's eyes.
Driven to distraction by the thought that the boy she had
taught to love had grown up to love another, she murdered
him."</p>
</div>

<p>"No," said the defense. "This woman was the victim of
blackmail. First she had been hounded until she gave way
to the big youth, and then she had paid him money from her
hoard in the hope that she might free herself of him."</p>

<p>Testimony on the blackmail point was clouded by the maze
of recrimination, but the State could not deny that Mrs. McDonald
had on several occasions given the young man money
with which to leave the city, but that each time he had returned
"broke" within a few days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Day's denunciation of Mrs. Dora McDonald was bitter,
but the defendant appeared to take no notice of what the
lawyer was saying.</p>

<p>Dora McDonald sat quietly as if in a trance; the bitterness
of failure, the weariness of defeat, was expressed in every
flutter of her purple-shadowed eyelids as she came before the
bar to answer for the murder of Webster Guerin, January 20,
1907.</p>

<p>Dora McDonald presented a pathetic appearance before the
jury.</p>

<p>She was dressed all in black. Not a single bit of lace or
white relieved the somber effect of her funereal widow's garb.
In arranging her hair Mrs. McDonald exhibited a novel idea.
The long, deep-auburn strands were braided into one plait and
this was wound over her temples in a single coil and fastened
with coral pins.</p>

<p>In its unaffected artlessness Mrs. McDonald's entry into the
courtroom and her removal of her hat as she sank into her
chair was an act of almost girlish grace. Her long black cloak,
satin lined, was thrown carelessly on a chair.</p>

<p>When she had removed her hat and cloak she looked squarely
into the faces of the jury.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dramatic Scene in Courtroom.</span></h3>

<p>The face that was turned piteously toward the jury was
deeply lined with the furrows of physical and mental suffering.</p>

<p>The eyes drooped constantly, and there were times when
she closed them for a full minute.</p>

<p>Every movement of the lips or eyelids, every arrangement
of dress and costume, was either studiously planned or pathetically
dramatic.</p>

<p>The weariness and bitterness were marked in the droop of
her mouth, in the perplexed wrinkling of her forehead, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
the stoop of her shoulders, in the relaxation of her hands,
lying heavily on the table before her.</p>

<p>A long, long line of battles she has behind her, with her
good name torn to shreds in the fight; and nobody can guess at
the scars and open wounds in her soul. No matter how great
may have been her fault, how untrammeled her impulses and
wishes, how wild and defiant her spirit toward the law and
society, now she is a tired, broken woman, who has lost the
day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bloom Gone From Cheek.</span></h3>

<p>There are many who say that the beauty of which Dora McDonald
was once so proud has departed entirely. The eyes
were heavy, the skin no longer showed the pink of health,
but was a dead white, her figure had fallen away until she
was almost emaciated, but there was a beauty in her sadness
and despair that the triumphant woman never possessed.</p>

<p>She seldom looked at the veniremen, nor did she appear
to be following the questions put to them. Occasionally she
glanced at a possible juror as he stepped up to be sworn, but
for the most part she sat with her head resting on her hand,
or looking ahead at some mental vision. Is it the face of
young Webster Guerin she sees, as he lay dead, or the face of
old "Mike" McDonald as he smoothed her hair and loaded
her with caresses? Is it remorse for a crime, or longing and
grief for a dead admirer? Or is it despair for a wasted life, a
hopeless future, a thousand lost opportunities?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">No Madness in Her Eyes.</span></h3>

<p>If the defense expected to utilize the plea of insanity it
would have had some difficulty in inducing a jury to believe
that Mrs. McDonald was greatly deranged. There was no
gleam of madness in her eyes. They were dark-circled and
languid, but not at all staring or strange. She seemed unusually
self-poised and collected.</p>

<p>Without any artifices of dress or cosmetics, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
gleam of gaiety or vivacity, it was not impossible to understand
why this woman wielded the great influence in the lives of
three men that she did. In the first place, her features were
regular and fine. Her eyebrows were delicately penciled and
her eyes large and dark.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Traces of Siren Left.</span></h3>

<p>The contour of her cheeks was soft and round. But one
can imagine, in happier days, that there was a captivating play
of expression, an esprit, a beauté de diable, that would be
particularly fascinating to a man like old "Mike" McDonald.
And upon such a woman would the self-made man, the gambler,
uncultivated and rough, fast approaching old age, delight
to heap luxury and adoration, as there is no doubt "Mike"
McDonald did.</p>

<p>And is it not easy to imagine that such a woman would have
a powerful attraction for a young man, with her sophistication
and experience matched against his ignorance? And now one
of the men is dead of a broken heart, and the other struck
down in the very first flush of his youth, and the instrument
of pleasure and destruction stands at the end of a shattered
life.</p>

<p>Until a jury should decide, in so far as human fallibility
may decide, just whether or how Dora McDonald shot down
Webster Guerin, that victim of tangled love and jealousy, a
waiting city hung expectant on every incident bared since the
day that the artist toppled before a pistol ball in his studio
with a woman of furs and furbelows standing sobbing above
him.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A "Sappho" and "Salome."</span></h3>

<p>A "Sappho" in a grimy city she was called because her heart
was touched by the strength of youth; a "Salome" because she
planted a kiss on his dying lips, but whether she was victim
or vampire, sinner or sinned against, was solely for the jury
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p>Cries of blackmail, of bribery, of frenzied jealousy, of shameless
love and daring intrigue, rang around the courtroom for
the long days of the trial, but for the jury it was only to look
behind the locked door of the artist's studio and see whether
the revolver with which Guerin was shot down was held by
the woman or the young man; whether there was malice or
accident or self-destruction, and what the motive for either
might be.</p>

<p>The shot that sounded his death was the climax to an attachment&mdash;guilty
or not, as the case might be&mdash;that began
when Dora McDonald was a wonderfully beautiful and younger
woman, the wife of a wealthy gambler, and the lady of a
mansion, and Webster Guerin was a mere lad, just old enough
to doff short trousers for manly attire.</p>

<p>Affection, money and attention were lavished on the young
man by this woman. At banquet board and in the theater
box they passed their hours together. Of this there was no
dispute. The sole question was whether the woman gave way
to the lure of a boy, or whether the boy was importuned by the
woman; whether in after years that boy blackmailed that same
woman, or whether she loved him to a distraction that brought
the madness of jealousy and the revolver.</p>

<p>And what of the love attachment? the police wondered. But
as they delved a little they unearthed strange and tender
things, but nothing more strange than poems written by the
woman and apparently dedicated to the youth.</p>

<p>The tragedy of a soul was bared when Assistant State's Attorney
Day read to the jury poems of passion found in the
reticule taken from Mrs. McDonald on her arrest.</p>

<p>The State regarded the declarations contained in the verse
as disclosing a dual motive of murder and suicide, and introduced
them as circumstantial evidence. One entitled "Mistakes"
was written on the day of the Guerin love tragedy.</p>

<p>Here is the first one read:</p>

<span class="i0">That our happiness lay in each other.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when soul finds its mate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is often too late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To struggle and fight against conquering fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what does it mean?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This parting, I ween;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll leave you, but, well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither heaven nor hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will make me forget you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor save you should I find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another holds the place that was and is mine.<br /></span>

<h3><span class="smcap">"Kill Me If You Will," She Says in a Verse.</span></h3>

<p>Another of Mrs. McDonald's poems, written on the day of
the killing, is as follows:</p>

<span class="i0">Kill me if you will, for all is well.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Have you learned the old saying of pearls before swine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave every pearl that ever was mine.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And it's hardly worth while for me to live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More blessed to give than receive, they say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I followed that teaching in my poor way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wanted returns, I'll have to confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I had to be cool, and firm and brave,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, by all the glory of God above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've proven the strength of a weak woman's love,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But I found too late that I was wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That love but existed in hopes and in song.<br /></span>

<h4><span class="smcap">Another Poem of Passion.</span></h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I waged a battle fierce and long,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And I struggle again to win, one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steps on the ladder that mounts to great deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the path to the right unfailingly leads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I gazed at the battlefield, flooded with gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the path to the right unfailingly bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew that the wounds came from contact with sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas demons let loose that float in the air;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Right has full sway.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reading of the poems was followed intently by the big
crowd in Judge Brentano's courtroom. Mrs. McDonald appeared
uninterested.</p>

<p>From poetry the step was easy into song. Accomplished
and educated as Dora McDonald was, with time hanging,
sometimes, heavy on her hands, what more natural than that
she should set her verses to music of her own composing?</p>

</div>


<p>The mother of the woman, an aged orthodox Hebrew, never
went near Dora McDonald until the trial was nearly done,
though that same old woman bent her knees as she day and
night raised her voice to Jehovah in lamentations.</p>

<p>Ill health, mental and physical, followed. All the sorrows
of a shattered life befell her.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sought Vindication to Spare Her Aged Mother.</span></h3>

<p>For Dora McDonald, life had been lived when Guerin died.
It mattered not after that whether she went to the gallows or
to freedom. But for one reason she would not have cared a
whit whether her case was fought before a jury or not. The
one reason was vindication that her mother might be spared
something of shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span></p>

<p>The vindication, however, was sought at a costly price&mdash;the
price of a life and heart and love bared to a gaping world.
It was an expensive effort to wash off the stain of an indictment.</p>

<p>At the trial Assistant State's Attorneys Edward S. Day and
William H. Rittenhouse wrangled with their own witnesses and
tried one after another to have them testify to things they
never saw or heard.</p>

<p>They attacked Inspector John Wheeler, Officer J. G. S.
Peterson, Thomas F. McFarland, Detective Wooldridge, Police
Matron Elizabeth Belmont, Charles Freudenberg, an old
soldier 60 years old, and threatened him with an indictment;
Louis Jacobs, Lorenzo Blasi, Herman Hanson and Charles B.
Williams.</p>

<p>All of those accused except Detective Wooldridge considered
the fulminations of Attorneys Day and Rittenhouse a good joke.
They regarded them as the vaporings of temporarily disordered
intellects, minds that had become rattled by a case which was
too big for them.</p>

<p>Owing, however, to the peculiar position in which he was
placed as the officer who made the arrest, Wooldridge was
forced to take cognizance of the matter.</p>

<p>Wooldridge denied the statements made against him and
branded them as malicious lies manufactured out of whole
cloth. He asked for a hearing before the Civil Service Board,
which was granted to him after the trial was over.</p>

<p>It was fully shown at the investigation how Wooldridge had
been treated in the matter, and the motive for his transfer; it
was also shown that he knew no new facts, neither did he meet
or know any witnesses except those who had testified to the
Coroner and Grand Jury.</p>

<p>The motives for his transfer and the reports were fully
uncovered and exposed.</p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge was exonerated by the entire Board of
Civil Service Commissioners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<p>Day and Rittenhouse simply sewed up the case in criminations
and recriminations.</p>

<p>Assistant State's Attorneys Day and Rittenhouse were outgeneraled,
outclassed and whipped, and wanted to throw the
blame for the acquittal of Dora McDonald on the Police Department
and failed. They did everything but try the case.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strong Defense by Lewis.</span></h3>

<p>Colonel Lewis said that the State had not denied that the
revolver with which Guerin was shot was his own. He called
for the weapon and showed the jury how Guerin might have
shot himself if Mrs. McDonald, in her struggle with him, had
merely pushed the revolver around in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>Again he called for the blood-stained coat that Guerin wore
when he was killed. It was too good an opportunity to be
overlooked by the fine dramatic eye of the Colonel.</p>

<p>"You remember the speech of Mark Anthony," he said; "how
he produced a tremendous effect with the robe of the great
Cæsar? I will not ask for more than the robe that this Cæsar
wore."</p>

<p>Thereupon he spread out the grewsome relic on the railing
on the jury box to show what he said were powder marks. In
his mind, there was no doubt about how the tragedy worked
out. Guerin, enraged and terrified when Mrs. McDonald told
him that she had told her rich and influential husband everything,
attacked her. He got the revolver out of his drawer,
probably to frighten her. Mrs. McDonald, half choked, saw
it gleam and pushed it away from her.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strikes Hard at Archie Guerin.</span></h3>

<p>More striking than the beautiful imageries and the wealth
of quotation from ancient and modern authors with which the
Colonel embellished his speech was his strong play upon "that
fifteen minutes," which, according to his interpretation of the
evidence, elapsed between the time the boys in Guerin's studio
were ejected and the time when Archie came out, leaving his
brother and Mrs. McDonald alone, behind locked doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>"There need be nothing else in this case for you," exclaimed
the speaker, "than this fifteen minutes unaccounted for. Archie
Guerin knew what was going on there, and before God he
should tell, but he did not. He hurried away and cleared the
corridors. Nervous and confused, he hunted up Harry Feldman
in the Windsor-Clifton Hotel, so that if anything happened,
he could say:</p>

<p>"'I didn't do it. You know I didn't, Feldman. I was right
here with you.'"</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">O'Donnell Moves to Tears.</span></h3>

<p>There were wet eyes in the courtroom as the real Dora McDonald
was brought to life in the closing address of Mr. O'Donnell.
The bickerings and the charges and the abuse that had
made the courtroom like a pothouse brawl all day were forgotten.
The woman's black clad figure and her white, despairing
face became the living picture of the world-old tragedy of
the judgment and the problem of pardon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The tragedy was in that room," said Mr. O'Donnell, pointing to
a plat of room 703 of the Omaha building, "and no one
knows how the life of Guerin was ended.</p>

<p>"I am not going to place a wreath upon the brow of this
woman. She is not all that a man would wish his wife to be.
She has traveled the devious pathways and her eyes have fallen
upon the shifting scenes of life.</p>

<p>"The Sabbath is coming on. Her ancestral people lit the
candles at sundown last night. Somewhere in this city a light
is burning where a Jewish mother is praying and hoping for
her erring daughter. You are approaching the moment when
you must do your great duty. You are here only to say whether
she killed Guerin with a criminal intent in her heart.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quotes the Gospel.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A daughter of Israel coming to judgment. She may have
been wayward, but we are not here to judge her past life. In a
temple of Jerusalem many years ago the Saviour of us all stood
before the multitude and they brought him a woman and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span></p>

<p>"'She has been taken in sin and she must die.' And he said:</p>

<p>"'Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone.'
And they walked away and left him with the woman. Then
the Master said to the woman:</p>

<p>"'Go and sin no more.'</p>

<p>"Let us pass judgment upon this woman as the Son of Man
passed it upon the woman of old that we may expect mercy
when we stand at last where the fallen woman of Jerusalem
stood."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. O'Donnell created a scene of profound dramatic features
when he based his contention that Guerin blackmailed
Mrs. McDonald upon a letter written by Guerin. He called
the ghost of Guerin to take the witness stand and testify against
the state's attorneys.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Acquittal Creates Thrilling Scenes.</span></h3>

<p>These were the scenes which attended the rendition of the
Dora McDonald verdict:</p>

<p>"Bring in the jury," said Judge Brentano, as he dropped
into the big leather-upholstered chair behind the bench.</p>

<p>Bradley was waiting for the word at the door to the Judge's
right. Looking very solemn and sphinx-like, the twelve men
filed in and took their usual places.</p>

<p>At the same time Mrs. McDonald came through the corridor
from the custodian's room, accompanied by her nurse, Miss
A. K. Beck. Miss Beck was trembling, but there was not a
tremor in Mrs. McDonald's hands or a movement of the facial
muscles to indicate that she felt the least excitement.</p>

<p>Attorney Norden pulled out her armchair for her and pushed
it under her again as she sat down. Every man in the courtroom
felt a choke in his throat, but if Mrs. McDonald felt it
she gave no evidence of it.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the judge, turning toward the jury, "have
you agreed upon a verdict?"</p>

<p>At first there was no answer, and the judge had to repeat
the question. That interval was like a lapse of a week or a month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. McDonald, who had not been asked to rise, sat facing
the jury and looking straight at them. She considered it only
polite to keep awake and to forego those beloved "dreams" of
hers in honor of the verdict, whatever it might be.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suspense Frightful.</span></h3>

<p>"Have you agreed upon a verdict?" repeated Judge Brentano,
a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"We have," replied the foreman, Hugh H. Fulton, rising
and displaying a paper which he held in his right hand.</p>

<p>"Let the Clerk of the Court read it."</p>

<p>A. J. Harris, the Clerk, was already in front of the railing
to receive the paper. He took it to his desk, and holding it
under an incandescent lamp, for the courtroom was dark, he
read, in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"We, the jury, find the defendant, Dora McDonald, not
guilty."</p>

<p>It was as though you had touched a match to a pile of gunpowder.
The people in the courtroom seemed to explode. They
did not cheer, or applaud, or shout, and yet they appeared to
be doing all of them. The tension was broken and a sort of
bubbling effervescence took its place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">McDonald Jurors Tell of the Verdict.</span></h3>

<p>"The jury found Mrs. McDonald innocent because they could
not feel sure that she did not act in self-defense, and, following
the instructions of the court, gave her the benefit of the
doubt."</p>

<p>This was the opinion voiced by Juror Charles McGrath. Mr.
McGrath said that the jury presumed the defendant sane, and
that the matter of possible insanity was not considered at any
time.</p>

<p>"I think that the jury attached a great deal of importance
to the testimony of Dr. McNamara," continued Mr. McGrath.</p>

<p>"He was the only physician that had made a thorough physical
examination of the defendant subsequent to Guerin's death.
We especially paid a great deal of attention to that portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
his testimony that told of the marks found on Mrs. McDonald's
neck, indicating that she had been choked. This evidence,
taken with that relative to the finding of the hairpins on the
floor, showed that there had been a struggle, and the court
had instructed us that if we found that there had been a struggle
we would be justified in finding a verdict of acquittal.</p>

<p>"Although I, perhaps, ought to speak only for myself, I will
say that I do not think that the members of the jury were
much impressed with the expert testimony."</p>

<p>Another juror said that those favoring an acquittal based
their arguments largely on the fact that most of the evidence in
the case was circumstantial, and that there was no absolute
proof that Mrs. McDonald fired the fatal shot at all, and that
if she did it was not shown that it was not in self-defense.</p>

<p>"It was mostly by argument along these lines that the conviction
men were won over, one by one," said this juror. "The
subject of the unwritten law was not gone into at all."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Woman Serene as Verdict is Read.</span></h3>

<p>Dora McDonald, in a state of serenity and composure that
is baffling even to those who are nearest her, was surrounded
after her acquittal by friends and relatives, who were weeping
for very joy at her acquittal.</p>

<p>She seemed quite unconcerned about it all, but when they
took her to one side and asked her how she felt about it, she
said, in the amazingly simple way she has:</p>

<p>"I am pleased. Do you want me to tell you the five reasons
why?"</p>

<p>They said yes, and though she lost herself several times in
the attempt, for she was very tired&mdash;these were the reasons she
gave:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1&mdash;Because no Jewish woman could ever do a deed like that
of which I had been accused.</p>

<p>2&mdash;Because it removes the stigma from dad's (Michael C.
McDonald's) name.</p>

<p>3&mdash;Because of my boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p>4&mdash;Because of my darling old mother.</p>

<p>5&mdash;Please believe it, last and least&mdash;absolutely least of these&mdash;because
of myself.</p>

<p>"The only real disappointment to me is that dad did not
live to hear that verdict, and that is my bitterest disappointment."</p>
</div>

<p>It had been the belief generally among those who followed
the case that the woman would not outlive the verdict long, no
matter what it might be. The original plans were that she
would be sent to a sanitarium in case of acquittal. She herself
is said to have planned that if let go she would make a
journey to Jerusalem, and there end her days in prayer with
her chosen people, in an effort to blot out her past. "Life can
never have any more meaning for her," Colonel Lewis said
when the jury first retired. "No matter what the verdict, it
is of little consequence to her, though she will die happier,
maybe, if she is acquitted."</p>

<p>In Jerusalem there is what is known as the "Wall of the
Wailing of the Jews." In the Valley of Tyron, at the foot of
Mount Moriah, on which now stands the Mosque of Omar, but
where formerly the Temple of Solomon stood, there are five
enormous stones built into the foot of the hill. A little courtyard
beside these stones, which Solomon laid as the foundations
of his Temple, is set aside for the Jewish race. Each
Friday this courtyard is filled with Jews wailing for the sorrows
of Israel. Every type of Jew, from the hunted Russian
to the wealthy American, may be found there, reading
from the Book of Lamentations, and sending the cry of sorrow
to the skies. It was here that Dora McDonald proposed to weep
out her ruined life.</p>

<p>But no, it is not the Place of Wailing in Jerusalem to which
Dora McDonald has gone. Hard as it is to believe of the woman
who so bravely passed through this tremendous ordeal, she has
stooped, stooped lower than one would believe humanly possible.
She has returned to the stage. She is now engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
attempting to have a play based upon the tremendous tragedy of
her life placed on the boards in New York.</p>

<p>She is attempting to lay bare to the gaping audiences of
cheap theatres the sores upon her soul. She has been calloused
to publicity to such an extent that she now hungers for the
public eye. She has placed herself in the same class with the
lepers outside the walls of Jerusalem who display their horrid
sutures and demand a penny before they replace the bandages.
To this petty end has come this greatest and most spectacular
of modern trials, this heart-shaking romance of love and life.</p>

</b></p>


<p>Mike McDonald's career in Chicago has been spectacular and
sensational to a degree.</p>

<p>The present-day generation in Chicago cannot appreciate
what the name Michael C. McDonald meant twenty years ago
in Chicago. There is not a single man today in Chicago, or in
any city in America who occupies relatively the position that
Mike McDonald did in the old days in Chicago.</p>

<p>He never held office, but he ruled the city with an iron hand.
He named the men who were to be candidates for election; he
elected them; and then, after they were in office, they were
merely his puppets.</p>

<p>While in recent years Michael C. McDonald has shown little
activity in Chicago political and sporting circles, living quietly
at Drexel boulevard and Forty-fifth street, in a costly mansion,
his name twenty years ago was a power in both.</p>

<p>Born in 1840 in Niagara county, New York, he came to
Chicago in 1854 and was a newsboy with John R. Walsh and
other pioneers, in the city's infancy. Before the war a business
venture took him to New Orleans, and when the south began
to become inflamed he returned to Chicago with enough money
to purchase the sample room of the Richmond House, Michigan
avenue and South Water street.</p>

<p>Here a spectacular career began. McDonald became the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
gambler of all the host of gamblers that were then growing
rich in Chicago. He also became one of the leaders in the
democratic organization. He made money hand over fist.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Begins Life as "Candy Butcher."</span></h3>

<p>Mike McDonald began life as a "candy butcher" on railroad
trains before the war. He sold peanuts and popcorn and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
mysterious packages not to be opened on the train, and fine gold
watches at $3.75 apiece.</p>

<p>Mike ran on many different railroads, although it must be
said for the sake of truth that his customers were often very
sorry to board a train and find that the energetic little candy
butcher who had sold them jewelry on the last trip they had
made had left and gone over to some other railroad. Mike's
old customers used to beg him to return to them. They even
dared him to come back.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Patriotic for a Price.</span></h3>

<p>The candy butcher made money and saved it, and during
the war he settled down in Chicago. Mike was very patriotic.
He sent many men around to the enlistment offices, especially
when big bounties were offered for volunteers. The trouble
with the gallant soldiers that Mike put into the service was
that after they got their bounty money they lost their enthusiasm
and faded from view, like an evanescent mist.</p>

<p>Mike made much money out of his bounty-jumpers, but
lost a good deal of it gambling. At this time he trained with
"Tip" Farrell, Charley Miller, John Sutton and Matt Duffy,
who figured more or less in the police records of that time.
Sutton was shot and killed in front of Pete Page's saloon, on
Clark street, in 1864.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the war McDonald and a notorious St.
Paul crook lost $600 in the famous game that Colonel Cameron
was running in Chicago. McDonald found out that the cards
were stocked against him, and it discouraged him with having
anything more to do with poker playing from the front of the
table. Colonel Cameron had taught him, at the expense of
$600, that the money in gambling was in running the game,
not playing it. From that day Mike McDonald never gambled.
He straightway opened his own game.</p>

<p>With Dave Oaks he started a game of faro at 89 Dearborn
street. It was a nice, little, modest game, with only those two
as the entire crew of the place. They took turn alternate days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
as dealer and roper in. The suckers who played the game used
to complain frequently that the firm of Oaks &amp; McDonald
worked sleight-of-hand tricks with the faro deck, and the unkind
police used to raid the game every day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Solved Gambling Problem.</span></h3>

<p>This frequent raiding cut frightfully into the profits of the
enterprising firm of Oaks &amp; McDonald, and set the junior member
thinking again. He had already solved the great problem
that it is better to run a brace game than to play one, but he
found there were thorns even in running a game. Therefore
he set to work to discover how these thorns could be removed.</p>

<p>The thorns that beset his career as a gambler were the police.
But the police acted under instructions from the chief
of police. The chief of police acted under instructions from
the administration. Therefore, McDonald figured out that he
would have to control the administration. So he straightway
blossomed out as a politician, and grew in importance until
finally he ruled Chicago, and realized the great ambition of his
life, to make and unmake things like chiefs of police, with a
curt nod of his head.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Once Ruled All Chicago.</span></h3>

<p>Mike McDonald never got over his hatred for the police
that was born in the days when they used to raid his little
game at 89 Dearborn street. He probably would have abolished
the police department entirely when he finally found
himself on the throne of Chicago, had it not been that he found
the police useful in making the other fellows behave, while he
could do as he pleased. And then, it was such a joy to make
the police bend the knee and acknowledge him as Lord and
Master.</p>

<p>Generally the superintendents of police knew what was expected
of them before they accepted the office, but once in a
while one of them had foolish notions about duty and law,
and had to be taught his place. Poor old Simon O'Donnell,
when he became superintendent of police, in the days when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
Mike McDonald ran "The Store" and ruled Chicago, got the
idea, because of numerous complaints of many patrons of the
gambling games in "The Store," that the place should be
raided. So he raided it.</p>

<p>It was a most impious act. It was like laying hands on the
Ark of the Covenant. Superintendent Simon O'Donnell lost
his job so quickly it made his head ache, and William J. McGarigle,
whom McDonald afterward made warden of the county
hospital, and who was indicted and convicted of boodling, was
installed as superintendent of police in place of the simple-minded
Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Mike McDonald's hatred and contempt for the police is
preserved in a joke that the few minstrel companies still left
on earth continue to cherish as one of their best beloved jests.
It originated with McDonald. One day, when he was in the
zenith of his power, a man came into "The Store" with a subscription
list.</p>

<p>"The boys are raising a little money, Mike," said the man.
"We'd like to have you give something. We are putting our
names down for $2 a piece."</p>

<p>"What's it for?" asked Mike, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Why," answered the man, considerably confused, "We're
burying a policeman."</p>

<p>"Fine," said Mike. "Here's $10; go and bury five of 'em."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Near to Penitentiary.</span></h3>

<p>While Mike was running the place at 89 Dearborn street
he became involved in an affair that put him in jail for three
months and made the portals of the penitentiary loom up
largely across his path. It looked for a time as if his career
was about to be nipped in the young bud.</p>

<p>In 1869 Charles Goodwin, assistant cashier of the Chicago
Dock Company, was found to be a defaulter to the extent of
$30,000. He fled from Chicago and went to California, but in
a few months came back and surrendered himself to the authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span></p>

<p>He testified that McDonald had lured him into the game
at 89 Dearborn street, where he had played and lost his money
in a series of brace games that lasted during a period of several
weeks. At first he lost a few hundred dollars, and he was persuaded
to go back to the Dock company's office and get money
out of the safe in order that he could return the next evening
and win back the money he had lost.</p>

<p>He never won anything back, but kept getting in deeper.
At length the poor, deluded victim was told to make a big haul
and skip the town. He made a last pull at the strong box for
$15,000 or $18,000, and his friends at 89 Dearborn street let
him play one last farewell game, at which they took the trouble
to see that the boy should not be bothered in his flight from
justice by lugging a big bag full of money around with him.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Case Finally "Fixed."</span></h3>

<p>McDonald was arrested, and the Dock company also proceeded
against him civilly, as it was not certain he could be
held on a criminal charge owing to the guarded manner in
which he had conducted his operation. McDonald was put
under bail of $60,000, and, being unable to supply it, remained
in jail for several months. Things were finally "fixed"
all right, though. A few days before his trial he was released
from jail, John Corcoran and Alderman Tom Foley going on
his bail bond.</p>

<p>The trial was a farce. All the gamblers, "con" men, bunko
steerers and strong-arm men in Chicago lined up in court and
told how the defaulting clerk had begged to be permitted to
play the brace game, with tears in his eyes, and that most of
his money had been spent on wine, women and song. The jury
solemnly declared McDonald innocent.</p>

<p>The expense of his trial on the charge of stealing the Dock
company's $30,000 had made McDonald poor, and he had to
get out and do a little "hustling." Soon after his release from
the county jail John Donaldson, a California gambler and a
high roller, made a winning in McDonald's place of $2,200 at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
poker. He took the money back to the hotel with him and was
robbed of it and $500 besides before he had been in bed ten
minutes.</p>

<p>A cracksman by the name of Travers was convicted of the
crime.</p>

<p>Donaldson used to go to Joliet every day or two to interview
Travers. Finally he came back from Joliet and never
ate nor slept until he had run McDonald down. Tweaking his
nose he shouted:</p>

<p>"Travers has confessed. You are a thief. You are a coward.
Within twenty minutes after I was robbed you were dividing
my $2,700 with Travers and his pal."</p>

<p>McDonald did not deny the charge or strike back at Donaldson,
as the latter apparently hoped he would. Donaldson was
a slight man, almost dead with consumption, but he was famous
as a man killer, and while with one hand he tweaked McDonald's
nose, the other hand was jammed down in his coat pocket,
and McDonald knew that if he made a move or said a word
he was a dead man.</p>

<p>Donaldson's hatred for McDonald became a mania with him.
He was a doomed man, anyhow, and he wanted to kill McDonald
before he went. So for the three years before death finally
claimed him he would drag himself about the streets until he
could stand in front of his enemy and slap him in the face and
curse him, and beg him to raise his hand or say a word, or give
him the slightest pretext for killing him. It was a great relief
to McDonald when grim death finally claimed Donaldson.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rises in His Profession.</span></h3>

<p>After the fire McDonald opened a place on State street, in
partnership with Nick Geary, a celebrated thief, who was subsequently
killed in Philadelphia. McDonald next moved to
the West Side, and was taken in by John Dowling, who gave
him a third interest in his game in consideration of indemnity
against police interference, McDonald's political star at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
this time being on the rise. The firm cleared $100,000 in less
than a year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/img145.jpg" width="448" height="550" alt="(gambling with skeleton)" />
</div>

<p>About this time McDonald formed a partnership with Harry
Lawrence and Morris Martin, and for four or five years they
had supreme control of the bunko business. None others could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
work excepting those who took the trouble to see the firm of
McDonald, Martin &amp; Lawrence. Among the gang who worked
under the protection of the firm were Tom Wallace, John Wallace,
"Snitzer, the Kid," John Martin, "Snapper Johnny,"
"Kid Miller," "Sir James" Arlington, or Gannon, "Appetite
Bill," and "Hungry Joe."</p>

<p>There is no telling how much money these individuals took
away from the unsuspecting public, but it is estimated at over
$1,000,000. Of this, 20 per cent went to the police, 40 per
cent to the roper, and 40 per cent to the firm. The latter furnished
straw bail, witnesses and juries, and other protection,
and the confidence gangs reported to it and received orders. In
1875 "White Pine" Martin shot and killed "Sir James" Gannon
in front of "The Store" while quarreling over the division
of the proceeds of some job.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Throne in "The Store."</span></h3>

<p>The firm of McDonald, Lawrence and Martin had opened
up the resort known as "The Store" on Clark street, on the
northwest corner of Monroe street, where the Hamilton Club
stands today. The first floor was operated as a saloon, and the
floors above as gambling rooms. After public sentiment became
aroused over the bunko business of the firm, Lawrence and
Martin drew out, leaving McDonald to run "The Store" alone.</p>

<p>"The Store" was the most famous place in Chicago in those
days. It was not only the rendezvous of all the sporting men,
politicians and denizens of the underworld in Chicago, but it
was virtually the city hall, for from his little office in "The
Store" McDonald managed the affairs of the city.</p>

<p>Every form of gambling known flourished on that wonderful
second floor. The most expert manipulators of cards that ever
dealt a second or shifted a cold deck sat behind the tables.
They were Clif Doherty, Frank Gallon, Billy Tyler, Charles
Winship and George Noyse.</p>

<p>High-ball poker, in which the roller holds the high ball in
his fist and rolls it to the cappers continuously, and faro, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
fifty-three cards in the deck, so that the odd could be dealt,
were said to have always prevailed in "The Store."</p>

<p>"There never was an honest card dealt in the place," is the
epitaph one old-time gambler has written on its dead proprietor.</p>

<p>Big as the place was, it was always crowded. McDonald is
said to have coined a very common phrase when, on one occasion,
one of his dealers protested against putting in more tables
and increasing the size of the gambling rooms.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mike," he said, "we won't have enough players
to fill up all the games."</p>

<p>"Ah, don't worry," McDonald is said to have replied, "there's
a sucker born every minute."</p>

<p>In politics McDonald's first great triumph was when he
elected Colvin mayor on the democratic ticket. Then he put
the elder Harrison in the mayoralty chair, and after that he
had plain sailing. His control lasted during the entire Harrison
administration of eight years. In all that time there was
no bigger man in Chicago than Mike McDonald.</p>

<p>The only time he met with a serious set-back was in 1882,
when he tried to elect William J. McGarigle, then chief of
police, sheriff of Cook county.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Big Courthouse "Job."</span></h3>

<p>Another disappointment of McDonald's political career was
when he got a bill past the county commissioners and city
aldermen authorizing Harry Holland to paint the outside of the
City Hall and County Building with a mixture which was
guaranteed to prevent the stone from decaying.</p>

<p>Holland applied his marvelous preparation, but when the
time came to pay the bill a newspaper man, John J. Lane,
who died only the other day in St. Louis, had dug up evidence
tending to show that Holland's preparation was nothing but
water and chalk, and not quite so efficacious in preventing the
decay of stone as prune juice or ice cream would have been,
but much cheaper. The county has never yet paid the $80,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
that Holland wanted for the job on the county building.</p>

<p>After the close of the Harrison administration a new day
began in Chicago. The independent voter broke the power of
party bosses. Mike McDonald's rule was broken. He could
no longer do what he pleased with city administrations and be
unofficial chief of police.</p>

<p>He bowed pleasantly to the inevitable, and stepped down and
out. He was wise in that he saw the handwriting on the wall,
and gracefully submitted instead of "kicking against the
pricks" and wasting his time and his money, as did other
gamblers and sports, who were finally crushed out simply because
they could not recognize that new conditions and new
men had come.</p>

<p>McDonald quit every sphere of his old life and went into
business.</p>

<p>It was he who, with William Fitzgerald, built the first elevated
road in town, the Lake street "L." Then, in 1891, he
thought he would like to be an editor. He bought control of
the Globe, a daily morning paper, and ran it for over two
years. It was not a financial success, and finally McDonald
gave it up. "I guess I was never cut out for a literary man,"
was his laughing remark. "There are other things I know
more about."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Domestic Life Rough.</span></h3>

<p>A great deal has been said about McDonald's domestic unhappiness,
but it was not until his body had been buried that
the truth was known.</p>

<p>His first wife was Mary Noonan, whom he married in the
days when "The Store" was the sporting and political Mecca
of Chicago.</p>

<p>It was a great scandal in the community later when she suddenly
disappeared, and it was reported that she had run away
with "Billy" Arlington, a minstrel man. It was the greater
shock because her devotion and loyalty to McDonald had been
the talk of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>

<p>One time she had stood, with a pistol, in her husband's
gambling house, and defied the police when they raided the
place under instruction of some blundering chief of police, who
did not realize that he was toying with the lightning when he
laid violent hands on anything that belonged to McDonald.
Mary McDonald had held her ground at the door in "The
Store," and declared she would shoot the first policeman that
attempted to enter. She was as good as her word, and one of
the officers was carried to a hospital with a bullet through his
arm. Mrs. McDonald, through her husband's pull, was never
prosecuted.</p>

<p>McDonald went to San Francisco and brought his wife back
and installed her in the house he had built at Ashland avenue
and Harrison street, considered in those days a veritable palace.
McDonald gave it out to the world that he had built the mansion
for his wife, and his taking her back after she was reputed
to have run away with another man was accepted as a
wonderful instance of his great-heartedness and magnanimity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sam Barclay Tells "How Mike McDonald's Coin Won
Dora Away."</span></h3>

<p>"Sam" Barclay (Harry is supposed to have been his baptismal
name) was one of the great ball players of the long ago,
and the shadows of the drama that wrecked his life are, therefore,
interwoven with the world of sport, and even with the
career of Charles Comiskey, "the master of the White Sox."</p>

<p>Barclay, a trim and graceful fellow, came into prominence
twenty years ago and played with Pittsburg and St. Louis.
At St. Louis he was under the command of Comiskey, who
therefore knew him well, and was always interested in his
doings.</p>

<p>On two or three occasions quarrels over the contracts of Sam
Barclay nearly wrecked organized base ball. He was a wonderful
second baseman, and one of the fastest and most scientific
players of the day.</p>

<p>In 1889 Barclay's knee went back on him, and, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
regained full use of the leg, he was never fast enough to play
his former game. He also began to take on flesh, and was
glad to retire from the diamond.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Opens Saloon in Chicago.</span></h3>

<p>Coming to Chicago, Barclay opened a saloon on West Madison
street. Back in 1894, West Madison, from Halsted to
Elizabeth, was the real red-light district, full of saloons and
concert halls. Barclay's place was the headquarters of revelry,
but Sam himself kept a good name for personal honesty and unbounded
generosity to his friends.</p>

<p>When the red-lights went out on Madison street, Sam leased
a saloon at 15 North Clark, where for some time he held the
same kind of sway he had maintained west of the river. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
place was ultimately lost, and he went over in Garfield park
district, without much success.</p>

<p>"Sam" Barclay, former husband of Mrs. "Mike" McDonald
II, 451 West Lake street, freely discussed his life with Mrs.
McDonald.</p>

<p>It was an interesting story, in which he told of Mrs. McDonald's
attempt to commit suicide once in Kansas City, of brawls
in his saloon, the "Half Moon," and of how "Mike" McDonald,
assisted by "Bunk" Allen, lured his wife away from him. Here
is what he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"They have printed stories that are not true about this case.
Mrs. McDonald's mother was a Mrs. Feldman, who at one time
lived at 619 Harrison street. At the time I knew her Mrs.
Feldman had been divorced from her husband and he was
living in the Ghetto.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Likely Lad of 200 Pounds.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was in '89 that I met Dora. I was in the Kansas City
ball team, and was a likely lad. I weighed 200 pounds, trained
down, and it was a good man who was able to floor me.</p>

<p>"Dora came to visit her brother-in-law in Kansas City. He
is Dick Vaughn, and a very good 'pal' of mine. I met her
there at his house.</p>

<p>"We took a liking to each other, so I used to have her in the
best seat every day at the games when we played on home
grounds.</p>

<p>"And she never was slow, I tell you, of giving me credit
when I made a double play or lined out a hot one.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nothing Like Real Love.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Well, the season came to a close. I liked the kid, but I
didn't feel nothing like real love for her. I was going to leave
Kansas City, and nothing was said about taking her with me.
I noticed that big tears came in her eyes when I told her, but
she didn't say much. That night they sent for me. They told
me that Dora was dying.</p>

<p>"I got to Vaughn's house and found her unconscious. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
had taken laudanum, the doctor said. She was in a stupor.
The first chance I got, I asked her what was the matter, and
she said to me, as the tears rolled down her cheeks:</p>

<p>"'I don't want to be left alone.'</p>

<p>"That, you know, touched me. We got married. I've got
the license right here. It was all doped up by a fellow in the
Washingtonian Home, who thought he owed a lot to me. He
certainly did some fine pen and ink decorating with birds, and
shadings and such things.</p>

<p>"So, after I quit the national game, I went into the saloon
business at 292 West Madison street, first, and then started the
'Half Moon.'</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the truth about how Dora met Mike McDonald.
She went to McVicker's theater one day with Harry
Summers, who is now treasurer of the Illinois theater.</p>

<p>"Dora was with Mrs. Elliott. She used to be a model in
Ryan's store, at Madison and Peoria streets. Summers introduced
Dora to Mike McDonald, and that's the way they started.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Day of Harrison Funeral.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Well I remember the time&mdash;it was on the day that Carter
Harrison's funeral went past the house, at 319 Washington
boulevard, where we were living at that time.</p>

<p>"'I met an old gentleman today who has lots of money,'
Dora said to me, as we looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"'It's funny how a man gets up in the world and then loses
it all when he's laid away in the narrow box,' I said, keeping
my eyes on the hearse.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, then, but not about what my wife said.
Afterward the words came to me, but I didn't realize the meaning
of her expression or what it had in store for me then.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Deep Game Well Played.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A few years passed. They went quick, then. Money made
the time fly, and Dora certainly was a spender. Then one night
they pulled off the game that was to separate us and give
Mike McDonald a young wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was boozy with wine. Bill Hoffman and 'Bunk' Allen
were masters of the ceremonies. They bundled me in a cab
and drove me to a place on Wood street. Detectives came in,
and my wife, too, and they there and then laid the basis of
the divorce suit which ended the game between Dora and I."</p>
</div>

<p>Barclay then told of a fight in his saloon, in which one man
was almost killed and another badly wounded. Then he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That's how they wound up the 'Half Moon.' Jimmy Quinn
said he was my friend, but he stabbed me in the back. I was
getting too strong in politics, so he got me and I was put down
and out."</p>
</div>

<p>Barclay had seemed perfectly happy with her, but one night
when he was living in rooms over his saloon at 15 North Clark
street he learned that Mike McDonald had come into her life,
and it was not long before the ball player's romance was ended.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wife Gets Divorce.</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. Barclay obtained a divorce&mdash;with McDonald's money,
so Barclay always said&mdash;and the ball player was left alone.
The blow proved his utter undoing. Barclay lost ambition and
energy. He spent hours in his rooms, gazing mutely at a huge
crayon portrait of his wife, taken a year before she left him,
and he seemed to have no desire or ability left for business.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Second Wedding in Milwaukee.</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. Barclay was married to McDonald in Milwaukee. At
the time she was in the chorus of the Chicago Opera House.
Her mother is Mrs. Fanny Feldman, 338 South Marshfield
avenue. She has two brothers, Harry and Emil Feldman, both
known in West Side political circles. Harry Feldman was employed
in the city clerk's office during William Loeffler's term.</p>

<p>When McDonald took his new wife to his house on Ashland
boulevard there was a red-hot family row. Guy, the elder of
the two sons of McDonald, had a pitched battle with her, and
the fight was carried into the street. The boy was victorious
at first, but his father sided with the stepmother, and eventually
the boy left home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span></p>

<p>Harold Barclay, 10 years old, Mrs. McDonald's son by her
first marriage, was adopted by McDonald, and with his two
sons, Cassius and Guy McDonald, has an equal share in the
estate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Induces Husband to Disinherit Son.</span></h3>

<p>Shortly after her marriage to McDonald, Dora became angry
at her husband's son, Harley. The latter objected to his father
contracting further matrimonial alliances, and did not hesitate
to say so. Mrs. McDonald prevailed upon her husband to
disinherit the son, and later, of her own initiative, caused the
arrest of the young man.</p>

<p>The charge was threats against her life. The case came up
at the old Armory police court, and the young man was placed
under bonds to keep the peace.</p>

<p>The breach between father and son is said never to have
healed. Young McDonald went into the sign painting business
soon after the episode.</p>

<p>Guy married Miss Pearl Flower, and lives in Chicago. Mrs.
McDonald once had Guy McDonald arrested on the charge of
writing threatening and obscene letters.</p>

<p>The case was hotly fought in the United States court. A
juryman, and warm personal friend of Mike McDonald, saved
him from conviction, which would have carried with it a penitentiary
sentence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Sting and Curse of Ill-Gotten Money.</span></h3>

<p>"Mike" McDonald, the king of gamblers, was buried like a
king of men. There were flowers, tears, friends, orations and
processions. But as clothes are not, neither is a funeral, an index
to character&mdash;nor even is the obituary column.</p>

<p>Strangers, reading the story of the last day above the sod
of McDonald's body, might has thought that Chicago had lost
a leading good citizen. They were told that McDonald had
amassed wealth, but they were not told how he got it. They
read of the great men whom he had befriended, but they were
not told of the men whom he had ruined. They were not told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
that Mike McDonald living, had violated the laws of the land,
of society and of the home.</p>

<p>"Mike" McDonald died worth a million dollars. A young
man beginning life, familiar only with the post-mortem, story of
McDonald, and seeing no condemnation of his method of getting
rich, might feel encouraged to hold to the idea that the
accumulation of money bars all criticism for the way it is acquired.</p>

<p>Though the publicity of cold type has put no brand on the
dead McDonald, the story of "Mike" McDonald's life and fortune
is not yet finished.</p>

<p>Suppose he did die worth a million dollars, whom will it
benefit? What good will it do?</p>

<p>There will be a fight in every dollar, a quarrel in every
penny.</p>

<p>There will be a strife among men and women over this fortune.</p>

<p>Much of it will go to lawyers to defend a woman charged
with murder. Much more of it will go to other lawyers who
will try to break his will. As McDonald's money was ill-gotten,
so will it be spent to no good purpose.</p>

<p>In a few years McDonald will be forgotten except by those
whom in life he ruined. His fortune will be gone. No one
will remember him for the good he did, if he did any good.</p>

<p>Let not "Mike" McDonald's success in securing money encourage
you to follow his method.</p>

<p>If you, young man, had an opportunity of entering a gambling
venture, with a certainty of securing for yourself a fortune
of a million dollars, you would be a fool to take advantage
of that opportunity.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the life of even a successful gambler
worth imitating and nothing that he does worth admiring.</p>

<p>"Mike" McDonald may have been better than the ordinary
class of gamblers, but the occasional good deeds that men of
his character do are always exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span></p>

<p>Ninety-nine gamblers out of a hundred that amass fortunes
die paupers. The money that a few accumulate, even as McDonald
did, is, as a rule, a curse to those that inherit it.</p>

<p>But if McDonald had sense&mdash;and we believe he did have
sense&mdash;in the closing years of his life he cursed the day when
he started on a career that wrecked him, socially and morally,
and left him in his dying hour a bankrupt in everything but
the possession of a few hundred thousand dollars, which he
could not take beyond the grave.</p>

<p>And what has happened after McDonald's death, and what
will happen in the courts of law, will prove to men that ill-gotten
money carries a sting to its possessor and a curse to
those who inherit it.</p>


<h3>WIFE NO. 1, WIDOW; NO. 2, REPUDIATED.</h3>

in His Troubles&mdash;Old Scandals Denied.</span></h4>

<hr class="r5" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Mary Noonan Now Claims Innocence and Fights to
Prove Divorce Illegal.</span></h4>

<p>The grave out at Mount Olivet that closed over the body of
"Mike" McDonald refused a final sanctuary to the life-tragedy
of the political boss and millionaire gambling king.</p>

<p>The same hand of death that closed his eyes on his triumphs
and afflictions raised the curtain on an unforseen last act in
this drama of Chicago life.</p>

<p>In this new part of the plot Mrs. Dora Feldman McDonald,
who turned the old gambler's head and broke his heart through
the shooting of Webster Guerin, appears as a wife solemnly
repudiated in death-bed rites. At the same time Mrs. Mary
Noonan McDonald, the divorced and exiled first wife, steps upon
the scene to cleanse her name of the scandals to which it has
been linked for twenty years.</p>

<p>While the two wives and the relatives stood before the coffin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
it came out that McDonald, shortly before his death at St. Anthony
de Padua hospital, had uttered a formal repudiation of
his second marriage, in the presence of the Rev. Maurice J.
Dorney, pastor of St. Gabriel's Catholic Church, and several
witnesses, in the persons of hospital attendants. This having
been done, McDonald was permitted the last sacraments of the
church and burial under the Roman ritual.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">First Wife Denies Charges.</span></h4>

<p>As the second wife passed under the ban, the first one came
forward to claim that of which she had been dispossessed by
human passion. Sitting in her apartment last night at the
Vincennes hotel, Vincennes avenue and Thirty-sixth street.
Mary Noonan McDonald gave her version of the romance and
tragedy that have measured forty years of her life.</p>

<p>"For the sake of my two boys, it is now my duty to tell the
world the truth about the slanders with which my name has
been blackened," she said. "I am not perfect, and I have done
things for which I am sorry, but I am guiltless of the charges
with which I have been hounded about the world for twenty
years. This I can prove, and to do so I shall remain in Chicago
as long as necessary."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Repudiation of Second Wife.</span></h4>

<p>It was after the solemn requiem mass over McDonald's body
in the Church of the Presentation that the Rev. Father Dorney
consented to tell the story of the gambler's dying repudiation
of his second wife.</p>

<p>"I told 'Mike' McDonald before his death," said Father
Dorney, "that in the eyes of the Roman Catholic church there
was no such thing as divorce; that he had but one wife, the
mother of his children&mdash;Mary Noonan. I told him he must
publicly repudiate this other woman, and only when he said he
did so could he receive the last sacraments, penance, holy eucharist,
and extreme unction.</p>

<p>"Although he was critically ill, he said, firmly, that he would
do as the church wished: that he was sorry for his sins, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
wanted to receive the last sacraments. Then, in the presence
of witnesses, as is required, he made the repudiation. Later
he went to confession, but what he told there I can never reveal.</p>

<p>"Afterwards the other woman, Dora Feldman, came to see
him at the hospital, but if he was conscious he never recognized
her. He was true to his promise, true to his resolution to put
her out of his life."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Church Not Interested in Will.</span></h4>

<p>Father Dorney's attention was called to the fact that McDonald
probably had left a considerable portion of his estate
to his second wife.</p>

<p>"I suppose he did, but this is a legal matter in which the
church is not interested. Mike McDonald and Mary Noonan
were legally married in the eyes of the law, and the church, in
a Catholic church edifice. We never recognize divorce. Of
course, we know it is impossible at times for men and women
to live together, and the church permits them to reside apart,
but remarriage is impossible as long as both of the parties
are still alive.</p>

<p>"McDonald never remarried in the eyes of the church, because
his first wife was not dead. By his actions with Dora Feldman
he gave great scandal, but before his death he repented of it. If
Dora Feldman followed Mike McDonald to his grave, she could
not do so from an ecclesiastical standpoint, and in my sermon
this morning when I referred to the wife of the dead man
I meant Mary Noonan McDonald, the mother of his children."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mary McDonald Changed.</span></h4>

<p>No greater contrast could be conceived than that between
the woman reputed to have deserted her husband in turn for a
renegade French priest and a minstrel, and the woman who
rose to greet the interviewer who called at the Vincennes hotel
for Mrs. Mary Noonan McDonald. Twenty years of sorrow
have left snow white hair that still crowns her head with the
same wealth as that of younger days, and twenty years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
struggle to support herself have dulled the fire of those gray
eyes that once looked over a smoking revolver with which the
girl wife held at bay the police raiders of her husband's gambling
house. But the slender figure appeared as erect as ever,
though standing forth with an added frailty beside her stalwart,
brown-faced son, Guy, and her face, though pale and sad,
scarcely confessed to her 60 years of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the woman who began her career in Chicago as the
helpmate of an old-time gambling king, and is ending her days
in the work of rescuing wayward girls; this is the woman who
was driven to abandon the name of McDonald and bury her
identity for the last fifteen years under the alias of Mrs. Grashoff,
holding communication only with her children and secretly
visiting Chicago periodically to see them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Tells Her Story at Last.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is sixteen years since I have talked to a newspaper reporter,"
said Mrs. Mary Noonan McDonald. "Again and again
have I been besought to tell my story, but long ago I determined
to remain silent until after the death of Mr. McDonald. For
the sake of my children's relations with their father I held my
peace, and now, for the sake of my children's name, I have
decided to give my story to the world.</p>

<p>"The lies that have been printed about me for the last twenty
years are but a feeble testimonial of the tremendous power
wielded by Mr. McDonald and his friends. None knows better
than I how he made and unmade public officials, set judges on
the bench, determined public politics in the old days, and
fought his enemies with a ruthlessness that made him feared
far and wide. When I became his enemy, I, too, began to feel
his power, as it was manifested in the public press.</p>

<p>"The lies have multiplied day by day, but I have so far refused
to answer them. Only during the last week the papers
have said that Dora McDonald, who ruined Mike McDonald's
life, and I, met at the bedside of the dying man. We have
never met. The only time I ever saw her was in a Providence
(R. I.) hotel, ten years ago, where I was stopping while at a
convention of charities. We sat at the same table, and I heard
her say to a girl with her that I looked like Guy's mother.
Then I knew who she was. I have not seen her since, not even
at the grave today, though I was told she was there."</p>
</div>

<p>Guy McDonald interposed to explain that his stepmother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
not been allowed to attend the funeral service at the church,
being taken directly to the cemetery.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Says Charges Were Invented.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The statement I want to make to the world," resumed Mrs.
McDonald, "is that all the stories told of my conduct at the
time I was separating from Mr. McDonald, are absolutely false,
and were maliciously invented and circulated. The trouble between
my husband and me grew out of his brutality. He was
a big, red-blooded man, but when under the influence of liquor
he was rough and disorderly. He often struck me at such
times, and mistreated me in other cruel ways.</p>

<p>"I finally came to the conclusion that I could stand the life
no longer. So I ran away. But I went alone, and not with
Billy Arlington, the minstrel, as the story was told afterwards.
I went to San Francisco and visited with friends, and while
there I met Arlington. He was only a casual acquaintance, and
I never saw him after I left San Francisco. I went from there
to Cincinnati, and thence to New York, with friends. We
stopped at the Gilsey house, and there William Pinkerton, Al
Smith, the old-time gambler, who had a resort at 86 Clark,
and Mr. McDonald, coaxed me to come back home.</p>

<p>"But it was not long before the old trouble began again.
Mr. McDonald was extremely abusive when in liquor, and Mr.
A. S. Trude will tell you that I went to his office one day and
asked him to get me a divorce. He tried to smooth matters
over, and succeeded for a time.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">No Chapel in House.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Then we went to live in the new house at 308 Ashland
avenue. There my troubles began afresh, and grew until 1888.
The newspaper stories have dwelt at great length on insinuations
of my conduct with a priest for whom I was said to have
built a chapel in my house. Nothing could be more preposterous
on the face of it, as any Roman Catholic will tell you. The
church does not sanction the erection of altars, the giving of
communion, and the receiving of confessions in private homes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
Dispensations for temporary masses can be obtained in rare
instances.</p>

<p>"There was a priest named Father Price, from Asheville, N.
C., who was raising money for his church in Chicago. We
gave a recital that netted him $500, after which he was a guest
for two weeks at our house.</p>

<p>"He obtained a dispensation to say mass a few times, and
did so before a temporary saint's altar set on a bureau. When
he departed the altar went with him, and that is as close as we
ever came to having a private chapel in our house.</p>

<p>"The French priest with whom I was said to have eloped
was Father Moysant. He never said a mass in our house, and
I never knew him except as one of the priests of the parish
who were entertained frequently by Mr. McDonald.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Leaves Husband; Goes to Sister.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I did not run away with Father Moysant or any other
person, the fact being that, unable to stand Mr. McDonald's
treatment, I left his house in the fall of 1887 and went to live
with Mrs. Peter McGuire, whose house stood on the site of the
present Studebaker building. I begged Mr. McDonald to let
my boys come to me, but he refused. At the end of three weeks
I went to New York alone, sailed for Havre, still alone, and
went to visit my sister, Mrs. Catherine Phillpot, who lived in
Paris.</p>

<p>"I remained there eleven months and returned to New York.
At the Fifth Avenue hotel, where I stopped, I found Pinkerton
detectives, hired by Mr. McDonald, watching me. I complained
to Mr. Philips, the house detective, of the annoyance,
as he will tell you. I was traveling under the name of Armstrong,
my mother's maiden name&mdash;she was English and my
father, Irish, you know. The annoyance of the detectives became
so great that I returned to Paris on the same boat on
which I had come to America. That was the middle of October,
1888.</p>

<p>"After six months with my sister in Paris I returned directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
to Chicago. When I arrived I found my daughter dead and
with my own hands I buried her baby the next day. I found
also that I had been divorced by Mr. McDonald in proceedings
before Judge Jamieson, though no notice ever was served on
me."</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Pawns Her Diamonds.</span></h4>

<p>Mrs. McDonald spread out her ringless fingers significantly,
and continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I went to a pawnbroker that day and sold my diamond
rings, ear-rings, and cross, and with the proceeds opened a
rooming house at 1235 Wabash avenue. Mr. McDonald often
came to see me and dine there, and it looked as if there might
be a reconciliation. But soon after that he met Dora Barclay,
and from that time we were friends no longer, but bitter enemies.</p>

<p>"The reputation of my house was ruined by the arrest of
Mike Coleman, alias Charles Wilson, the safe-blower, who had
lived there a few weeks, and at first I thought Mr. McDonald
was behind this plot to ruin me. I went to the Animosa, Pa.,
penitentiary, saw Coleman, and learned that Mr. McDonald
was innocent. But after that a story was started that I lived
with Coleman for years. I never saw him after that time at the
penitentiary.</p>

<p>"After the World's Fair I removed to St. Louis and started
a boarding house at 2686 Locust street. But soon Mr. McDonald's
detectives were hounding me there, the newspapers
began to print stories of our troubles, and my business was
ruined.</p></div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Driven to Hide Identity.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I saw that if I was to live peacefully I must bury my identity,
and so, assuming the name of Mrs. Grashoff, I went to
New York, and obtained employment with the Board of Charities
at Fourth avenue and Twenty-third street, of which Mr.
Van Vordenberg was the head. For fifteen years I have been
in charitable work. I founded the Destitute Old Ladies' Home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
at Paterson, N. J., and at present my work is with the Crittenden
Rescue Homes for Unfortunate Girls. It is not the least
solace for my many misfortunes that I have been able to save
many girls from continuing their wayward careers.</p>

<p>"So much for the lies circulated about me for twenty years.
I never saw Father Price after he left Chicago, nor Father
Moysant after I went to Mrs. McGuire's. Both are living, so
far as I know, but where, I do not know."</p>
</div>

<p>But the records show, according to Mrs. Mary McDonald,
that her husband repented of the wrongs he had heaped upon
her, and called her to his bedside when he was dying, acknowledging
her as his wife, and begging her forgiveness. They were
reunited, and a few days later McDonald died.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Opposed by Documents.</span></h4>

<p>For Mrs. Dora McDonald, on the other hand, an entirely
different case is made out by her attorney, Colonel James Hamilton
Lewis. He said that he had procured new evidence in
the shape of affidavits and sworn statements of witnesses in the
suit for divorce brought by "Mike" McDonald against Mary
C. McDonald in 1889, and letters in the handwriting of Mary
McDonald, and others.</p>

<p>The divorce bill, according to Colonel Lewis, was filed in the
Superior Court of Cook County on September 11, 1889. In the
complaint, McDonald alleged that he married his first wife
November 20, 1870, and lived with her until May 1, 1889. He
alleged misconduct in the complaint, naming Joseph Moysant,
or Father Moysant, a renegade priest, and gave dates and
places of alleged misconduct. He also alleged that Mrs. McDonald
had fled to France with Moysant, and that she was not
a resident of Chicago, or the State of Illinois.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Joint Letters in Evidence.</span></h4>

<p>Letters were offered in evidence which were alleged to have
come from Mrs. McDonald to women friends. Some of these
are said to have been signed Mrs. J. Moysant, and to have been
partly in the handwriting of Mrs. McDonald and partly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
handwriting of Moysant. These letters are said to have shown
that Mrs. McDonald had a knowledge of the divorce suit pending
against her.</p>

<p>An attempt was also made to prove that Mrs. McDonald was
deeded certain property by McDonald in connection with the
divorce proceedings, and that she negotiated and disposed of that
property in part, thus, acquiescing in the terms of possession and
establishing the legality of the divorce.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary McDonald, now a white-haired woman upward of
sixty, declares that she has brought suit to establish her legal
status as the widow of "Mike" McDonald for the sake of her
two sons, Guy and Cassius, for whom she desires to clear her
name of any stain. Her petition for an injunction restraining
the trustees of the estate from paying to Mrs. Dora McDonald
any money as dower rights was heard by Judge Barnes on
November 18.</p>

<p>The contest was long and bitter between the attorneys.
Crimination and recrimination flew thick and fast. In the
end, however, Judge Barnes decided that the divorce of Mike
McDonald from Mary Noonan McDonald was legal, that the
law could not go back of the records, and that, therefore, Mary
Noonan McDonald was not entitled to any share of the McDonald
estate.</p>

<p>But the sordid contest over the ill-gotten money of the gambling
king was not yet at end. Dora McDonald failed to pay
her attorney's fees, and the estate was again brought into the
courts on an injunction obtained by James Hamilton Lewis,
who threatens to throw the estate into involuntary bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Thus the long battle over tainted gain goes on. Let those who
think gambling an easy way to wealth and power read aright
the lesson of the life of Mike McDonald; one continual tissue
of law-breaking, imprisonment, divorce, scandal upon scandal,
murder, adultery, leaving a name covered over and associated
with all vileness, all the mud and slime of society, to go down
to the grave with a broken heart. Is that an alluring spectacle?
Is such a life worth living? Who would emulate it?</p>

<p class="center">The World's Great<br />
CRIMINOLOGIST<br />
AND DETECTIVE</p>

<p>After twenty years of
heroic warfare and scores
of hair breadth escapes, in
which he suffered wounds
and bruises by the hundreds,
and baffled death so
often that his criminal enemies declare "he leads a charmed life." Mr. Wooldridge,
while still "in the harness," has given this volume to the public with the belief
that he is sending forth a book with a mission of good to the world.</p>

<p>No man in all our country is so feared by evil doers of all classes as the author
of this revelation of the ways and wiles of wicked men and women, who graft and
swindle, rob and corrupt their fellows in defiance of law and justice.</p>

<p>"The Incorruptible Sherlock Holmes of America" is the title by which Mr.
Wooldridge is favorably known. Hundreds of times large and tempting bribes
have been offered him by wealthy criminals; thousands of dollars at a time might
have been his for a "wink" at a nefarious practice, or for the loosing of his hold
upon a rich criminal's wrist. But like Cæsar's wife, he stands "above suspicion."
He is still a poor man, but deeply and earnestly studying the science of criminology,
laboring and lecturing for the cure of crime by wise laws and scientific means&mdash;declaring
himself to be the enemy of crime, but the friend of the criminal, whose
disease of crime he believes can be cured, and that it is his mission to help the world
suppress crime and find out the way for its elimination.</p>

<p>With an aim so lofty, and a motive so pure, the good people of every religion,
all trades, all professions and all classes are in hearty sympathy, and the circulation
of this book will not only serve to warn the people against the snares and pitfalls
of the Devil and the Grafter (into which thousands of new victims fall and one
hundred and sixty millions of dollars of the people's money are lost every year),
but it will tend to make Grafting impossible and turn the Grafters into honest,
legitimate channels and good citizenship.</p>

<p>This Book should be in the Hands of Every Minister, every doctor, every student,
every teacher, farmer, business man, mechanic and laborer, every wife and
widow&mdash;statistics show that ninety widows out of every hundred are swindled out
of what their husbands leave them. It should be in the reach of all, male and
female, for there is not a postoffice in all the land where the mail, every time it
comes, does not bring the alluring literature of the Grafter to swindle or tempt the
unwary.</p>

<p><strong>The book contains over 500 pages</strong>, is profusely illustrated from specially drawn
pictures and photographs of desperate criminals and law-breakers, such as murderers,
highwaymen, safe blowers, bank robbers, diamond thieves, burglars, porch climbers,
shop lifters, bicycle thieves, box car thieves, lottery swindlers, gamblers, women
footpads, panel-house thieves, confidence men, pickpockets, procuresses of young
girls for immoral purposes, women gamblers, levee characters, etc.</p>

<p>This great production is not a ponderous volume filled with dry statistics, but
made up of thrilling accounts which depict the most noteworthy incidents in the
lives of criminals in large cities.</p>

<p>During Detective Wooldridge's service on the force he has made 20,000 arrests,
secured 125 penitentiary convictions, recovered $75,000 worth of lost and stolen
property, which was returned to its rightful owners; seventy-live girls under age were
rescued by him from houses of ill-fame and a life of shame and returned to their
parents or guardians or sent to the Juvenile School or House of the Good Shepherd.</p>

<p>It is well known in police circles that Detective Wooldridge has refused at many
different times, bribes of from $500 to $4,000; $10,000 was offered for his discharge
or transfer from the levee district by criminals against whom he had waged a warfare.</p>

<p><em class="italic">He has letters from Carter H. Harrison, the mayor, three state's attorneys, eight
chiefs of police, three assistant chiefs, six inspectors, nine lieutenants, six police justices
and others too numerous to mention, which testimonials are printed in the book together
with their autographs. The book contains all the General Superintendents of Police
of Chicago from 1855 to 1901.</em></p>

<p>Detective Wooldridge has a wonderful record in police annals.</p>
